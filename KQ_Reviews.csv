Constantly canceling flights,Kenya airlines canceled my flight mid my journey. I left Johannesburg Airport after flight time change then I was transiting through Nairobi to Cameroon the flight was canceled so I slept in the airport and the next morning put on another flight which first went to another place before taking me to Cameroon. I'm supposed to fly out on the 7 August and I have a function I'm coordinating in one week and my flight is canceled. The information counter people just don't care about the complaints they send you to different places.,,2024-08-02T17:39:56.000Z

If your thinking of Kenya Airlines...think again..,"If your thinking of using this airline...RUN don't walk away!!! Despite providing everything the airline wanted about my medical issue, they left me at the airport check in for over 3 hours while they continually lied to me that the ""Station Chief"" was coming to see me as to why I was denied boarding. They made multiple reasons why the Station Chief never showed up. There is no ""Station Chief"". I  requested several times that their medical staff be contacted to find out what the issue was. ""We don't do that"". Their staff was totally unresponsive to any request that I asked.They continually lied about when I would receive a refund on my flight. Still haven'treceived it. There probably lying about a refund.",,2024-07-30T21:23:34.000Z
Worst airlines ever,"Worst airlines ever, not friendly staff, no flight communication or updates, flight was delayed for 1 hour from Johannesburg and then for the transfer flight to Dubai has been cancelled and then got delayed by 2 hours 30 minutes.  This airline will not see me again.",,2024-07-29T23:47:06.000Z
We were trying to go to Nampula from Nairobi and never arrived,"We were trying to go from Europe through Nairobi to Nampula and back again. Connections from Nairobi to Nampula every 24 hours. Connection was cancelled and we were brought to a hotel. 24 hours later, we were allowed to enter the plane but it never took off. They did not have a spare part for something they claimed to be a routine procedure. They needed to go to an external airbase to get it. It took them 5 hours to fix and afterwards, they suddenly remembered that the pilots cannot work overtime and only then they started looking for supplement pilots. Of course they failed on this short notice. We did not get any food, flight was supposed to leave on mid-day and we waited for takeoff until 5 pm. After that we tried to cancel the trip and get back home. Nairobi airport was a real mess, I queued many hours and got a flight ticket at 1:50 am next day as they all went home and left only one capable lady in charge. All partner hotels were full and I had to sleep on cardbpoard paper at the airport. Remaining staff had very strong nerves and tried their best, but overall management was very bad. The only good points: we got food vouchers at the airport and the luggage arrived undamaged 1 week after me.That was in April, and in July I still have not seen any cent of compensation for this failed trip which cost me more than 2,300 €. This seems to happen often. Never again with Kenya Airways.",,2024-07-25T09:20:16.000Z
My friend was recently returned to the…,"My friend was recently returned to the UK after visiting SA and had to return via Nairobi by Kenyan Airlines.  OMG. He had 10 hours wait in Nairobi and one of the customer advisors decided to to corn him. He was asked to pay deportation fee of almost £800 which was alleged to be demanded by the SA government 🤔 🙄... He was reluctant to pay by the particular gentleman insisted that he was going to be stranded at the airport if he missed his flight...  remember he had a return ticket to SA😭💔. For peace and obviously under duress and being tired, he asked fir a link to pay and guess what?

What a con?....When he git back to London,  he tried to contact the airline but hit dead ends...",,2024-07-11T10:25:33.000Z
Terrible Customer Service & Ignored Emails,"Due to the airline ""fuel shortage"" and subsequent cancellation of our flight from Johannesburg, myself and a colleague were advised that we would need a hotel for the evening and were booked on a flight the following day.However, we were also informed by the ground staff that all partner hotels were fully booked and would have to pay for our own hotel and claim the costs back from Kenya Airways, we were given an official letter with contact details of who to make the claim with.This was Mid-April 2024 and I have still had no response from their ""Customer Relations Executive"" Obert Nthite whom I have emailed several times regarding a refund.Their customer service is terrible and I would not recommend this airline to anyone.John Brewer",,2024-07-09T10:05:25.000Z
Claim for First Needs Allowance ignored after delayed luggage,"On a work trip, my luggage did not make it with me to Lilongwe. Apparently there had been an issue with too much luggage for passengers, meaning that every plane coming in only carried luggage from the previous flight. I was told my luggage would arrive the next day on the next flight. I was never contacted by Kenya Airways about any updates on my luggage. Instead, during my high level workshop with government, I had to keep stepping out to check if my luggage had made it yet. When I finally reached them around 4pm I was told my luggage was there, but that I had to pick up the luggage myself. However, the office of Kenya Airways had closed, meaning I could not pick up my luggage that day, but had to wait until the next day. I had to make expenses on buying formal wear to attend the workshop, and made a claim for reimbursement on the 27th of May 2024. A customer officer replied soon saying my claim would be expedited to the Lilongwe office and I would soon get a reply. Since then I have followed up with multiple phone calls and e-mails but I have since not heard a thing. Terrible, terrible service from Kenya Airways. I have had delayed luggage with other airlines, but was always followed up with, been shown how to make my claim for reimbursment of costs and the luggage was delivered to my place of residence as soon as possible. With Kenya Airways, my experience was the absolute opposite. Terrible customer service.",,2024-07-16T12:58:28.000Z
"CDG to HAH, no checked baggage received for all the plane","I had a flight from CDG to HAH transiting in NBO. This was my first flying with this company and I decided to trust them despite all of the bad reviews I can read or heard.The cabin crew was quiet correct. But the plane was small, the pilot was not very reassuring during the taxi phases and on top of that I did not Even get my checked baggage. Knowing that I travelled with an infant, 80% of my luggage where for my son ( diapers, Food, medecines).Nobody on the plane received their bagage, we were tell that the plane was too small.How can this company sells ticket with condition knowing That they dont get the right plane ?",,2024-06-21T21:37:51.000Z
Smooth and pleasant flight,"Very smooth and pleasant return flight between Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. I was constantly kept informed and the phone was promptly answered whenever I called. Great customer service overall. I was particularly impressed by flight attendant Peter Omari who was extremely kind.  The return flight was delayed, but it wasn't the airline's fault. Will certainly fly KQ again!",,2024-04-30T21:18:57.000Z
Never paid what we agreed upon for delayed luggage,"My family of 4 flew from Gothenburg to Nairobi in Dec 2023. When arriving to Nairobi 3 of our 4 bags where missing. They arrived 2,5 days later and since we were already out on a safari in Masai Mara, we had to pay extra money to have them flown out to the camp.After the vacation when returning back to Gothenburg, all 4 bags where lost again and returned to us a couple of days later. We immediately filed a complaint which (after several reminders) took the customerservice a couple of months to answer. We agreed on an amount per lost bag and sent them the documents that they requested to finish the refund. Then - no reply for another couple of months before an agent contacted us to request somewhat the same documents for a second time. That was mid-June. We have now sent the requested documents again + several reminders to the customerservice, just to find that they have now blocked our emailadresses completely. I guess their strategy is to wear our the customer by not answering at all, so that they don´t have to pay the claim. The worst customerservice ever! We have flown longdistance many times with many different airlines, and this handling of our errand is by far the worst we have ever experienced!",1,2024-07-09T10:35:17.000Z

The group wasn't offered water and food for 6 hours, no hotel offered or emergency beds. Children had to sleep in the closed airport on the floor for the night.

Worst Airline ever,"First of all, my name is Emmanuel.Kenyan Airways is the worst airline to fly with. The service is disgusting, and they don't give a damn about their customers. Air Mauritius flew me and my brother from Perth, Western Australia to Mauritius. Kenya Airways was supposed to pick us up from Mauritius to Ghana and then to Liberia. They later canceled our flight and put us on Emirates, and from Emirates, they transferred us to a flight called Asky. Since we arrived in Liberia on the 28th of May, we haven't received our suitcases yet. We have been following up for a long time, but we are still getting the same story every day. My advice to international travelers: if you want to reach your destination without any issues such as bad service and lost luggage, stay away from Kenyan Airways. They are very bad at everything.",,2024-06-02T15:03:12.000Z
"Lost bags, cancellations, avoid",Flew LHR to Lilongwe Malawi and they didn’t load my bags onto the connecting flight. 25 people on my flight didn’t get their bags. Each day I returned there were 20+ new people without bags. I did get them back but only when nearly ready to return home. Spoiled the whole trip. Cancelled my return flight home. Offered no compensation or recompense for extra expenses…. Still trying to get some money back for all the extra cost and hassle. Not hopeful.,,2024-06-06T17:05:08.000Z
Don't use this airline,"Don't use this airline! Turned up at Mombasa airport at 2.30am to be informed ticket had been suspended (i.e. cancelled). Had to pay an additional £2,100 to get home and spent two nights sleeping in an airport. No warning given and yet every time we flew they sent an email trying to sell us upgraded seats. They couldn't even be bothered to send an email about the ticket being suspended, which would have prevented the problem.  No refund given despite the airline selling the seats again. They have effectively collected twice the cost and would only refund the £60 tax!  They have no interest in consumer protection nor do they have any interest in treating customers fairly.  Quite frankly, they are a disgrace to an otherwise lovely country. If you go there use a UK/EU carrier and avoid Kenya Airways at all costs!!!",,2024-04-23T18:54:36.000Z

I have flown a few times with Kenya,"I have flown a few times with Kenya, and generally found them okay for the price and convenience. Unlike the Middle East Airlines, they try to solve problems when they happen. They don't have the same service guarantees as European Airlines but unlike European Airlines (Lufthansa) they have never left me stranded, so I haven't got anything to complain about, apart from the very small seats, and the enormously fat woman who sat next to me on my last flight, and kept invading my space. The flights are usually full, which makes them less polluting per passenger, but it does mean no space for changing seats.",,2023-11-17T11:51:32.000Z

Joburg-Nairobi-Amsterdam 26-27 June…,"Joburg-Nairobi-Amsterdam 26-27 June 2024 on Boeings 787-800. Checked in online from Rwanda and came to Joburg in transit for positioning. I arrived very early and would have to spend some 10-12 hours in the airport. However, the Kenya airways staff at the JNB transfer desk, a Ms. Nosisi, was kind, talkative, and very cooperative allowing me to depart on a 7 hours earlier flight. I then would avoid excessive time in JNB a tight onward connection in Nairobi. She did this, without any pay for ticket change, BP renewals, and retagging the luggage. I even got a much greater trip on a Dreamliner instead on my scheduled B737, which was another win as they have wide lie-down seats. My only cost was to forsake a preordered meal. The SAA lounge in JNB is gorgeous, impressive, and world class, now used by Skyteam, Star Alliance, and a number of airlines, as SAA have very few flights these days. The catering, bar, tarmac views, and space are all worldclass. From Kenya Airways, Ms. Nosisi, even came up to the lounge to find me in person to confirm my new boarding. She assured me that the inscribed luggage had passed security check and was onboard this earlier flight. Boarding easy though had to stand 25 Minutes in an airbridge, until the cabin was fully ready. Onboard, seats, and IFE was fully functioning. Catering was good and preordered meal accommodated on the last leg. Plenty of drinks of acceptable standard, though nothing extravagant. Only Tusker beer is offered; it’s of poor quality. Food tasty, well presented and extra hot dishes given on request. One meal service when going to Nairobi (4 hours flight) and two meal services while going to Amsterdam (8 hours). Pre-departure champagne is still their beloved JB Gobillard. FAs are good, attentive, and caring. Drink offerings onboard appear to be generous/unlimited. WiFi onboard useless. IFE fairly good. Transfer/transit in Nairobi went smooth, though we had to disembark by busses in the middle of night. The busses got filled, no premium toward business class nor Skyteam priority. Security checks quick. Pride lounge is good but was full, likely due to their new Asante Awards FFP with status match of elite-fliers offered widely, granting excessive access to the lounge which are now used at absolute maximum capacity. I watched the UEFA 2024 football tournament on TV; eventually, I even got a bed in the sleeper section to recharge for my next flight in the morning. Woke up early and got a lovely breakfast and shower prior to boarding to AMS was not very far from the lounge, all went smooth and on time. This flight to AMS had more perks than the previous. I got one more hot meal service round, amenity kit, mattress, etc. Arrived at Amsterdam as scheduled, and continued with their partner, KLM. Cooperation with KLM is still smooth despite that KQ has left Flying Blue Luggage transferred correctly. Ticket promotional, rendering value for money. Miles given quickly.

no reclaim for delay,"29. februar 2024Reclaim for delayI went from Nairobi to Heathrow 26. February, on my way to Copenhagen.  Due to the delay I did not catch the plane to Copenhagen.There was a lot of trouble getting another booking and very little help.  We had to move from one terminal to another until eventually we got the boarding-card.  No offer of any serving which we were entitled to have.  The delay was around 7 hours hence we are entitled to get a compensation of 600 Euro.I sent all the relevant boarding-cards and timetable as prove.I sent my claim to Kenya airways and got a standard answer.  I tried several times to get a proper answer but all in vain.  I had to start over again all the time with a new reference-number.After 3 month I got the final answer that according to some paragraph they were no entitled to give me any kind of compensation.  Nothing at all.I will avoid going with Kenya airway.  The plane itself also seemed to be in a poor state.  We had ordered a seat with extra room for legs, and there the screen did not work.  They pretended that they could restart it and see if it would work.  It was quite clear that it has not been working for a very long time and they just pretended it was a now thing.

Forced to sleep with a baby in the waiting area,"4 hour delay which meant we missed our flight to Paris from Nairobi. This resulted in a promise about Hotel stay overnight, a dinner and transportation to and from the hotel. After waiting an hour we were told, that the hotel wasn’t an opportunity but that we could have a free meal. We couldn’t get a discount on staying in the lounge, and therefore had to stay in the airport waiting area overnight with three children aged 0, 3 and 5.

Frankly unacceptable behaviour and no urgency to refund in full. Strongly advise to never book with this airline!",5,2023-02-25T16:11:34.000Z
Surprised about the amount of negative reviews,Our flight from Amsterdam to Nairobi has been canceled due to technical issues.

I have now rang Kenya Airways and MyTrip multiple times to get an update and they are both blaming each other. Kenya Airways stance is that MyTrip should refund the money and the get the money off the airline and vice versa.Kenya Airways don't have an ADR so will need to complain to the Civil Aviation Authority directly.My advice is to never use MyTrip as a booking agency or Kenya Airways as an airline of choice. A complete shambles and almost impossible to get your money back.Horrible experience!,,2023-12-04T12:26:55.000Z

That is surely proof of the excellent service that I have always received, that I keep returning to them.  From check-in to arrival at the other end I have never been able to fault their service and attention to detail.  Even when my wife found that nothing on the dinner menu suited her palate, as all the dishes had spicy overtones, the cabin crew bent over backwards to ensure that she had something to eat.  Where other airlines might have adopted a take it or leave it attitude, Kenya Airways excelled.I have always found Kenyans to be very helpful and friendly, and this shows in Kenya Airways' cabin crew and ground staff every time.Asante sana Kenya Airways.",,2021-04-03T13:23:19.000Z

I was subsequently booked onto another flight leaving earlier than the cancelled one, but as I wasn't told the original flight had been cancelled I missed the rebooked flight. Trying to get another flight booked was an exercise in futility - one ticket staff at JKIA airport who looked like she was ready to crawl under a table. No communication, no one actually seems to care and I would not fly with them again.

Our flight was cancelled from Johannesburg to Nairobi with less than 24 hours notice. This meant we would not make our connecting flight from Nairobi to London Heathrow. Only communication they sent was a very brief 'noreply' Whats app message. No phone number or email address for us to contact. Staff at service desks in the airport were unhelpful and disinterested. One of them was downright rude. At no point have we received an apology or explanation for the cancellation. We had no offer of food or accommodation. Eventually we found out we had been rebooked onto a flight the next day. However one member of our party needed to get back more urgently so was forced to book flights with another airline at cost of £600. The airline have ignored our many requests for a refund for that person's flight which legally is what they are supposed to provide, especially as they managed to rebook other customers into those seats so essentially have now taken money twice! They have also ignored our requests for compensation for the financial damage incurred in having to make alternative travel arrangements which again they are supposed to provide as per the Montreal Convention. The rest of us eventually made it back to London 24 hours later than planned after many hours spent in hot, sweaty airports. The ""Pride of Africa""! What a joke!

Decent experience with Kenya Airways,"After reading awful reviews of Kenya Airways we were anxious about flying with the airline. But we had the best experience, from booking to landing.Everything went smoothly considering we flew over the Christmas period. Our flight left with a two hours delay, the seats in economy are a little narrow but enough leg room, not much difference with other airlines. We tend to fly economy and have to accept seats are not the most comfortable but hey…. Price reflects that. And we have more budget to spend on the actual holiday. The flight attendants were absolutely ok, polite, and relatively efficient. Plane food is very very rarely great so we bought sandwiches, treats at the airport. They served drinks during the flight. The toilets were pretty clean. One was out of service but that happens.On the way back the flight was 2 hours late too but they served drinks, etc and no big deal, they kept us updated.Both journeys our luggage was fine.When booking with Kenya Airways, one needs to bear in mind, they are flying with an african airline, after a pandemic that affected many many airlines. If you are used to luxury and wont « compromise » dont travel with Kenya Airways, we will travel again with them as flights are direct and experience was absolutely fine. On the way to Nairobi we learnt the flight in the afternoon was cancelled, so our experience would have likely been very different.",1,2024-01-04T12:41:53.000Z

Nothing of this had been communicated on Kenya Airways or Kenya- or Swedish embassy web pages. So 1/2 of Eur 600 I paid for the round trip ticket should be refunded. But this criminal company called Travelgenio decided to pocket that money instead of refunding me! This was their answer: “Thank you for contacting us. In reply to your request we inform you that partial refund is not allowed.

Instead of getting validation or any care, I was told exactly the following‘We’re not going to turn back for you so get off the plane if you aren’t feeling unwell.’I continued to say that I was unwell and may need a sick bag or get access to a toilet if there is a queue and he just kept saying ‘ we won’t land, or turn back’I just couldn’t believe the level of care. I understand they also have a protocol to follow about unwell passengers but atleast have some decency and express some validation and care that it was a hard situation for me.Safety video wasn’t played when we took off but then was played 2 hours before landing- it was broken and all TVs stopped for an hour.We were also circling the air before landing in Heathrow, London for 30 mins but only an update was given once saying we would be landing soon.Terrible food, disgusting treatment , never flying again with then",,2023-07-31T21:05:26.000Z

They offer you an egg and toast with a cup of coffee, unbelievable that they don’t even offer a decent meal and some water at a bare minimum. The ground staff are so incredibly inefficient, 3 people at the desk helping one person, you would swear this is the first time they had to change a flight. With all of KQ’s delays I would assume not. The plane’s seats could also do with a cleaning. Its clear they have financial problems and are on the cheap. One suggestion would to try be on time as to not have to pay additional costs and then make an already bad experience worse with a dry egg and some toast. Rather just close down.

Still waiting for refund,"Covid restrictions have impacted a lot of airlines understandably but that is no excuse to withhold money from your customers when flights are cancelled. I am still waiting for refunds for two additional payments made directly to Kenya Airways for cancelled flights in March and May 2021. I have called them on numerous occasions and I'm always told that the matter is being 'escalated'. The only thing that is escalating is my blood pressure over this injustice. Add to that that it sometimes takes over 45 minutes to get through to someone in the phone and that promised return calls are never made. I've stopped flying with them now, not a difficult decision given that they are not the cheapest flights to east Africa anyway.",,2022-02-07T11:30:58.000Z

This airline is a joke,"Our flight from London to Seychelles with the stopover in Nairobi was delayed by two and a half hours and there was no apologies from their side. On top of that we didn't make it to our final destination,as we missed the flight because of the delay,caused by operational issues. Then we were left alone at the airport for over 5 hours with the staff ignoring our requests for water or any snacks or a place to stay. We've been also told to apply for a Kenyan visa,so they could book the accommodation for us,but the system was down,so we had to wait again. Another thing is that the employees are incompetent and don't know what to do and there were different answers to the same questions. One more issue with them,is that if you want to claim your luggage, you have to request it and someone will approve or deny it within the our and if you've been lucky enough and your request was approved you will wait another couple of ours to get it.

It was a desperate hotel, poor food, tacky decor and far from the airport. We didn’t understand why we were not accommodated in Crowne Plaza or any of the airport hotels. We spent the rest of the day there feeling very uncomfortable. They rerouted us through France because we had missed the connecting flight.

We were supposed to connect at 20.35 but the flight is delayed till 22.35. Very cleverly done, just under 2 hrs so that the airline doesn’t have to pay compensation.

Business class upgrade is day light robbery,"We had flown in from Dubai to Nairobi on Business class and it was good. Hence on our way back I decided to upgrade and fly business class, expecting the same. It was the biggest mistake in my life. The so called business class was just close to the premium economy of most other airlines. Seats had some push back and that's it. The leg extender was stuck and won't extend. Cabin crew said they were helpless - they didn't even try to see if it can be worked. I had to spend the entire flight sitting upright cos without the leg extender to support, I was slipping down if I reclined the seat. Horrible experience and to top it all there event wasn't a TV on the 5 hour 20 minute flight. Cabin crew said that this aircraft only has so much facility and they were looking at each other and smiling when they heard that I actually upgraded to business class.I would like to know how I can claim a refund. Where and how can I escalate this matter to. I sent a dm on Twitter to the airline which they haven't responded. Such day light robbery must not be permitted.

Finally Received Compensation From KQ!,"This is an update to my previous review below submitted a few months ago. I finally received 600 Euros from KQ. I think that they really don't have the staff to deal with things when problems arise hence the delays. Staff did eventually reply to emails and I think there is possibly too much emphasis on bureaucracy and the pace of work may be slow ""Kenyan time"" (I used to live and work in Kenya). This is clearly not acceptable for an international airline to inconvenience customers further when entitled to compensation.The process from my original complaint until receiving a response was around 1 month and 6 months to receive compensation. The Resolver website was very useful in this process.My flight to Nairobi from Paris was cancelled due to the pilots strike in Nov 22, I only became aware of this when I arrived in Paris from Birmingham with Air France. I managed to get to Nairobi a day late with KLM but then Kenya Airways connecting flight to Kisumu also cancelled, finally manged to make it with Jambo Jet.Air France looked after me in Paris but Kenya Airways basically abandoned me in Kenyatta Airport at 11pm, no food, accommodation etc.I have complained to Kenya Airways and eventually they agreed to pay 600 Euros compensation. They have had my bank details for 2 months now, still no payment and very little communication from them. I was advised it would take ""at least 30 working days"" that time has passed now and when asking when I will get paid no response.""The Pride of Africa"" used to be a good airline, very disappointed and frustrated with them, this issue has been going on for over 4 months now.",,2023-05-30T07:57:00.000Z
kenya airways ripped us off,"aug 9 2021 my family received a positive covid test while in kenya. I called kenya airways to discuss moving the flight. They told me 'no problem' they would leave our tickets open. We should call when we have a negative test, and they would give us a new flight.  When we received negative tests, i called, and no problem, we had a flight for that night. Except they were sending me a link to pay an upcharge because tonights flight cost more than my original flight. fine. I open the link, and they are charging me $6000 on top of what i already paid for the round trip tickets. this must be a mistake, so I called back to the call center and got the same person. No, this wasnt a mistake. even though this replacement flight was literally the same scheduled flight, only a few days later, they were going to rip me off. I tried calling several times, but was given the same answer, and eventually they would hang up the receiver of the phone when I called. I put the 6000 on a credit card and we flew home that night. Kenya airways made off with my money.",,2021-08-21T13:19:50.000Z
Worst airline in the world,"Worst airline in the world. They canceled my flight and it took me two days to change my itinerary, I spoke to dozens of their support operators and received only empty promises and bullying. They just kick from one operator to another and taunt me. As a result, we succeeded in changing the route. And when I arrived at the airport, it turned out that another shoulder had been cancelled. They changed my itinerary to include the canceled flight. Again! Is a mockery. Now I have to stand in front of their counter in the crowd to torment my kids with new expectations and bullying from the airline. They simply cancel unfilled flights and collect all passengers on one flight. They save at the expense of others. Everything they do turns into a creepy useless farce with scary slow-moving clowns. Whether it's organizing a flight or online support or arranging a transfer to a hotel. Always useless waiting for hours and a mess in everything. On social media they just write to me how sorry they are that I had to endure all this. Answer every time with their stupid answers. This is why reviews don't work on their site! There will be too much truth. They ate my brain with their stupidity and unprofessionalism. They will never refund me the money for the prepaid rental car and accommodation in the Seychelles for these 3 days or return 3 days of life spent on their worthless operators!What inflamed consciousness came up with the idea to call them the pride of Africa? They are a disgrace to Africa. Africa is crying because of people like them.",,2023-06-15T20:34:28.000Z
Hostile damaged baggage policy,"I always fly KA to Kenya. Staff are polite, food is decent and service is efficient. I recently returned from a trip to Kenya, only to find my hard shell suitcase was damaged beyond use - the integrated lock was broken, as was the handle. My taxi service managed my luggage so I didn’t realise it till I’d left the airport. Their damaged luggage claims policy is designed to put claimants off. First email with photos attached was acknowledged after 3-4 week and asked me to complete a claims form that was hard to edit, and write another cover letter in a very specific format. This was sent and again never acknowledged.it was also hard to return as 2 out of 3 email addresses copied into their response rejected my email due to file size (only 3 photos and 2 simple documents attached) Three weeks later I chased up a response only to be told that wear and tear is expected and I would need to claim via my travel insurance. When I explained such insurance charges an excess that basically negates the claim value they said their decision is final. I travel a lot and have used this particular suitcase for less than 20 flights - it was in good condition. Where an airline damaged my suitcase one other time, I received an instant replacement. Frankly, Kenya Airways has a hostile damaged baggage claim policy designed to put all but the most persistent claimants off. KLM as a parent company should take a good look at this. I’m disgusted by such a lack of integrity and professional responsibility.",1,2023-05-25T09:46:37.000Z
KQ Terrible customer service and KQ customer relations don't bother to reply,"Sudden cancellation then change of flight. I was checking in a third bag which I could pay for in USD according to the website but the KQ staff insisted I have to pay in rand in South Africa at the airport. Yet I had put in I am checking in a 3rd bag. Their system was down for a while a day before the flight. They claimed I was going to miss my flight and said if I went to get my tax revenue I would miss my flight. Because that is the money I would have used to pay for my 3rd bag. They insisted I leave my third bag in South Africa, which I had to do. I am from Uganda! When I got to immigration I was so upset and immigration told me my flight was not for another hour and they said it was wrong for KQ to have done that. Immigration was sympathetic.When I got to Kenya (transit), they claimed that my ticket from Johannesburg was still open and appears I did not fly in and they started asking me how I got to Kenya! I said I probably walked or took the ferry!! Then it became a back and forth with me walking up and down as I am sent from one KQ ticket desk to another! I finally managed to secure a seat and got to Uganda much later meaning I failed to spend New Year’s with my 82 year old mother!When I got to Entebbe, my home country airport there was further delay because they had misplaced my luggage! I got it two days later and they had managed to break my Panini press which has been well packed in my case! I put in a complaint as soon as I found out in Jan and now its April and still no response from KQ. Once a real person wrote to me and then did not get back all these months. When I write I am sent numerous 4 references numbers from their customer relations but zero action. I have no idea why KQ is still in operation. At the airport in Kenya a passenger travelling from a foreign land told the customer service that when they found out his predicament all they had to do was apologise. The KQ customer service just looked at him bluntly and never said sorry! They don't care and they don’t know airlines collapse for such reasons!",,2024-04-25T07:04:35.000Z
Joker airline,"I booked a return business class flight from Heathrow to Zambia. Everything went well until a night before my return when I accidentally stumbled on an email to check-in in a weird way. Usually I prefer to check in at the airport, but the email did not seem like a proper check in email. On reading further , I saw that They had cancelled my already pre booked  flight from 4months prior and rescheduled to a flight that was not suitable without prior notice. They basically informed me that if I couldn’t get on that flight , I should book something else and get a refund after.  Booking a return flight less than 24 hrs before take off!!! WHO DOES THAT!!! People have priorities, people plan their lives to prevent disappointments. People have responsibilities that need to be attended to. I had to rebook a one way return flight that was over £2300 with another airline so that I can make my commitments in Zambia to fit in with my previous plan. My total flight cost was approximately £2500 before this disaster which I thought was a good deal. Efforts to contact customer service that night was unsuccessful. They picked up and when you start talking they hang up. I submitted a complaint and their response was they can only offer me $200 of travel money for my inconvenience which I have decided not to accept as it’s a slap in the face. What a joke of an airline. Avoid at all cost. It will definitely get grounded in the nearest future or probably go into administration.",,2023-06-26T10:40:26.000Z
Worst airline in the whole world!,"I am writing to express my deep disappointment and frustration regarding the experience my family and I had on our recent flight with Kenya Airways. Our journey, which took place on 5th May from Toronto to Nairobi, was marred by a series of issues that significantly impacted our comfort and overall satisfaction.First and foremost, the condition of the seating on the aircraft was unacceptable. The seats in our designated area were unable to recline, making it impossible for us to find a comfortable position for the duration of the flight. Additionally, three out of the four screens in our section were non-functional, depriving both adults and children of any entertainment options during the flight.Furthermore, we encountered serious problems with the meal service. As passengers seated towards the back of the plane, my family and I were informed that all non-vegan meal options had been exhausted, leaving us with only vegan choices for the entirety of the journey. This lack of sufficient meal provisions was highly disappointing and left us feeling neglected and hungry throughout the flight.Moreover, the earphone inputs provided were faulty, rendering them unusable and further contributing to the overall dissatisfaction with the onboard amenities. As a 6-foot, 230-pound man, I found the seating arrangements wholly inadequate and was not even offered a proper seat that could accommodate me comfortably.Overall, this experience was deeply disappointing and fell far short of the standard of service that we expected from Kenya Airways.",,2024-05-13T17:51:25.000Z
"Asthma attack, panic attack","I booked 2 seats for my husband and myself August 20th, 2022. Our flight was delayed until 1:10am We were separated during a 14 hour flight from Nairobi to NY. I can not travel by air without my emotional support partner. They could not sit us together. The flight was full. People were arguing. I had tremendous anxiety and panic attack. I had to take a massive dose of sedatives on board. Dropped my pills all over the floor. The woman next to me had a dog. I had to use my rescue Inhaler every 30 minutes. Finally passed out from all the sedatives I took. Woke up to a child screaming relentlessly. I had severe chest pains, tight chest, wheezing, cough, nausea, hands and feet were numb the whole flight. Food was terrible. Worst experience of my life. Took a trip to the ER when we landed and had to have IV steroids for broncho-constriction and IVFs for dehydration. Never again. I just wanted to go home. They also checked our bags multiple times. I just wanted to sit down before the flight before I passed out. You can go through my bags all you want, but have a chair I can sit and rest if you're going to put me through that. Obviously I am tired.

A caricature of how the airlines sector is slowly crumbling,"KQ used to be good but service has been deteriorating significantly over the years. Let me start with the positives... the pilots are good. I have always enjoyed smooth flights with KQ. Unfortunately, that's the end of the positives. Flights are consistently delayed, queue management is dismal, the complete loss of flexibility for baggage weight (i was asked to pay excess baggage for 2 kgs extra for the first time in 20 years of flying with multiple airlines around the world), client facing staff seem either upset or apathetic most of the time and baggage management is undependable (they have misplaced my check-in baggage on multiple occasions now each time nearly doubling my travel time on short-haul flights).From what I hear, the employees are not treated particularly well by the company, and I empathize with them losing motivation. However, that said, I cannot continue to fly again with such an unprofessional airline and have decided to use one of the many other alternatives available in this part of Africa until I see a change in the corporate culture of this airline.",,2023-03-28T11:05:36.000Z
Kenya Airways - DO NOT Use this airline.  This is the worst airline. Here are the reasons why...,"My niece traveled to Kenya in June 2022 to train with the women's national basketball team.  The team will be traveling to Loudon to compete in a tournament.  When she arrived in Kenya, her two bags did not make it to Kenya.  She then put in a missing bag claim.  Two weeks later my niece still does not have her bags, which means she have no clothes and/or personals. No one can give her any information on her bags.  It's like they disappeared!!So I decided to contact the @supportKenyaAirways to see if I could get status from the United States.  Kenya Airways contacted me on Whatapps and I explained the situation to the customer service rep.  The man said, that her bags was in transit and asked me to sent him $1.5K to get my niece bags.  So I asked him why would I send Kenya Airways $1.5K to retrieve her bags ( this does not make sense).  He came up with this crazy explanation. So, I told him this sounds like a scam and you are trying to get money from me.  Then we was disconnected. #hotmess #book-at-your-own riskBelow are reasons to NOT to waste your money on Kenya Airways:1).  Fraudulent Activities2).  Bad Customer Services3).

They denied boarding without reason just they had hunch that passanger is not fit to fly. seriously?? please note, passanger was healthy, was walking on his own, never required any medicle equipment but just required wheelchair due to fever. we asked wheelchair and showed them doctor letter saying require wheelchair so that they can help, but insetad they denied boarding saying he needs MEDIF form signed by doctor and which take 24 hours. We even asked that we dont need wheelchair and asked them to let us boar as a norma passanger but they dont have mentality to support. Baggage counter staff said wait on side and we will help later. 2 hours past and boarding time is arrived, now same person said we cant help and you cant board. we complained to Ellinda manager but she was not ready to talk and keep saying call customer support. Called customer support no answer. emailed them for refund and its been a month but we are still following up and we have not received refund.On the other hand, Ethopian airline was very helpful. when we went to counter and explained them our situation, they not only booked ticket immediately but also provided us with extra legroom seat along with wheelchair.This is the treatment for busniess class customer. we were observing their behaviour with economy passanger which is terrible.Book if you want your blood pressure to go up and down if something goes wrong as they never help. If you want to see, just try messaging their whatsapp support, its automation will reply you quickly fo 3-4 response but then you keep waiting for hours and hours and when agent comes online, he just ask some random question and leave and you again wait for hours and hours.

If flights run to schedule, all is well, cabin crew are polite and friendly and I would travel with them (despite not being the most comfortable of airlines)Have experienced delay twice and Kenya airways staff at Nairobi have treated us awfully both times. The first time we were travelling with a 5 month baby from Mombasa - London. Mombasa-Nairobi flight was delayed so we missed our onward connection. We landed in Nairobi at 1am and were advised staff would be on hand to help us and we would be accommodated in a hotel as the next available flight was not due to depart until 9am (especially as our luggage including pushchair had been checked all the way through). There were no staff available. We walked to international terminal and staff member insisted we had no entitlement to hotel or food and needed to wait in the airport for 8 hours because we were economy passengers. A business class passenger who was with us very kindly insisted they give us his room because we had a baby, no pushchair and a long wait and he would use the business lounge instead. They eventually relented and sent us all to the hotel but this was their legal requirement from the outset.The second time we were delayed in the opposite direction and missed our Nairobi-Mombasa connection. We were told all flights were fully booked and we had to wait in Mombasa airport for 8 hours - once again refused to send us to a hotel. Staff lied that it would take us an hour to get there when google maps told us the allocated hotel was 15 minutes away. They eventually allowed us to use the domestic business class lounge - whilst better than nothing, they still refused us our right to a hotel room.Claims for compensation were closed and ignored until escalated via CAA and then they were forced to look at them.",4,2023-10-24T17:26:55.000Z

Within that time, my PCR TEST would haveexpired and I would have been unable to continue my journey thus leaving me stranded in an unfamiliar country.

My refund request has been denied 3 times, each timewithout adequate justification. The changes were made by Kenya Airways and no fault of my own. Kenya Airways took no responsibility for the changes made to flight and kept refering me back to travel2be.

My experience so far,I booked a return flight with Kenya Airways from Newcastle to Livingstone Zambia. On the second leg of the journey my flight was cancelled.  I was required to stay in Amsterdam 2 nights before onward travel was organised for me by KLM (Skyline Partners) Cost for the stay about £300. There was no charge for onward travel.When returning from Livingstone the airport check in was unable to process my ticket . It had not been programmed correctly. Attempts were made to rectify this but despite 4 hours of effort the return flight left without me.I contacted Kenya Airways. They offered me a new flight ( for 2 days later ) that they said I would need to pay about £1200. Huh! I was at the airport and available to travel but must pay for a new flight? What's that all about?As it was the flight offered was unacceptable. It involved an 11 hour layover in Nairobi. Not something a person of my age and medical conditions could endure. No alternative was offered despite my request. I could clearly see that better alternative flights were available.With no further response forthcoming I booked a return flight with Air France another Skyline partner of Kenya Airways. The cost of the two day delay a further £300 for accommodation etc. Then the price of a new ticket another £1000. My original ticket was about £700 and seemed good value at the time.So I had a ticket that was invalid on the return trip. £600 of expense for the 4 days I was obliged to stay extra in Amsterdam and Livingstone. £1000 for the cost of a new ticket to get myself back home.Total. I reckon Kenya Airways owes me about £1600.Will I get it?Initial negotiations  are not going well. Customer relations are not coming up with any answers to my questions as yet.Early days but having read other people's reviews I'm  not sure that the airline actually refunds anything?Is a legal challenge the only option?If someone from Kenya Airways actually monitors Trustpilot I'd  love to know your response and how you will assist me.Update.

From beginning to end our experience…,"From beginning to end our experience was dreadful. We have problems trying to board flight. Covid was causing some issues. If they had taken the time to to look at our paperwork and listen to us there shouldn't have been a problem. Food was diabolical. Got to Nairobi and flight had been delayed by 12 1/2 hours and wasn't told anything about accommodating us for this period. The hotel and journey to it are a whole other saga. Due the the delay of connecting flight in Nairobi we then went on to miss the next two connecting flights. I spoke to the check-in desk asking what is happening about our connecting flights.  The man there out and out lied to us saying the boarding pass's are valid for the next leg of the journey. No they weren't.During flight they were supposably sorting this out. No they didn't. In effect we had been dumped. So when we got to Amsterdam we didn't have a connecting flight. We had not been given any information as to were to go and sorting out our transfer. We got to the transfer counter and there was nothing on the system about us. I will add at this point we were a family of five, one of which was a two year old. The young lady at the transfer did give us our flight to Dublin. She did say however, that she wouldn't charge us for this flight but they wouldn't be able to do this again. We had already paid for this flight. I've had to put a one star rating to write this review but quite frankly, they don't deserve that. Needless to say,  would not recommend Kenyan airways at all.

Kenyan Airways a disappointing experience,"Travelling from Mombasa to Nairobi using Kenyan Airways, was without doubt a miserable experience!We sat on the runway and took off 30+ minutes late.To get a drink of any kind was almost a humiliating experience! When given it seemed the stewardess begrudged us them!During the flight an elderly lady fainted and the sight of her being manhandled down the aisle, in a bear hug, will haunt me for ever!Arriving late we were subjected to a race across to International departures, two interminable baggage/body searches (yes they are necessary) then a run through the airport accompanied by a Kenyan Airways staff member to arrive at the boarding gate to be told too late doors closed. The reported fact that the flight took off two minutes early hardly made us satisfied customers!Now Kenyan Airways really made their indelible impression!We were told to go to rebooking. On arrival we found one poor member of staff trying to deal with at least 12 passengers, all of whom had had enough, and were baying for blood!Fortunately another staff member arrived and eventually we were dealt with. After an interminable wait a flight for the next day was arrange. Our passports taken and an immigration note handed to us. We were then sent to baggage reclaim to have hotel accommodation arranged. The clerk clear uninterested in weary travellers made the barest effort and seemed disinclined to earn his wages, was eventually persuaded to secure a hotel, and sent us into the car park to find Holiday Cars transport. It was nowhere near where he had directed us, but we found it.The lady in charge demanded a blue slip, and was disgruntled that I hadn’t been given it. A telephone call confirmed we were entitled to travel and she ushered us aboard the bus. We were told we were waiting for one other traveller, some two hours later and a further 5 passengers we got on our way! The journey took only 20 minutes, enough time to have made the three trips that would have seen customers ensconced in the hotel in a timely manner!To our amazement we were expected and the booking in experience was faultless!We were pointed to the dining area where we were assured food was waiting for us.Not so! Eventually a tureen of soup and a bowl of bread rolls arrived. Having had nothing to eat or drink for 8 hours, heaven had arrived! Or had it? The soup was cold, the bread rolls stale, but were eaten. The only others from the bus, two hardy Brits, came in had one spoonful of soup, disappeared in disgust to their rooms. After another long wait food started to appear. A tray of greens, a tray of what looked like roast potatoes, then a tray of fish and a tray of what could have been chicken in a brown sludge.One look persuaded us that none of the food on offer was worth risking, we retired to our rooms. We now ha 90 minutes before being picked up for our return to the airport. I decided a shower and a cat nap were in order.Imagine the scene! I am naked ready for a shower, turn the water on and a mere trickle comes out of the down spout, trying to engage the shower the knob comes away in my hand. Ah well sleep it was.Once in reception I informed the desk clerk of my misfortune, with the shower, he shrugged gave me the bill to sign and ignored me!The price of the stay was less than £10, not worth £5. I bet that the hotel survives on Kenyan Airways, will never fix the shower.Kenyan Airways your advertising slogan does not live up to your claim!",,2023-03-01T18:44:52.000Z
"3 bookings, 3 flights cancelled, no support","Mine and my husband's flight was supposed to be on April 16th, 2:40 AM from Mumbai to Kigali. At 09:30 PM on April 15th, we arrived at the airport and saw that the first flight (to Nairobi) had been delayed 9 hours, and I would now depart at 11:45 AM on April 16th. We were already frustrated, as we would miss our connection to Kigali and have to arrive one day later. However, we tried to be patient and wait for the hotel/transport/food voucher.  We waited for 4 hours at the airport, during which the Kenya Airways staff said they were ""trying to book a hotel"", but NOTHING was provided. At 2 AM we were so frustrated and tired that we decided to book a hotel/dinner/taxi from our pocket and try to get a few hours of sleep.Due to this delay, we missed our 1-hour connection from Nairobi to Kigali, and instead, we were allocated an 8:30-hour connection in Nairobi.

Kenya Airways staff reassured us several times that we would get a hotel in Nairoibi during the connection, but when we got to Nairobi, they said they could only provide dinner, and we were given the wrong information. We also tried moving to an earlier flight from Rwandair from Nairobi to Kigali, but we were denied this request and completely disregarded by Kenya Airways staff in Nairobi. They didn't seem to care at all about our situation.To have ZERO support for a 9-hour delay on a night flight, to stand for 4 hours waiting for our assistance/information that never happened, be misled by the staff who assured us we would get a hotel in Mumbai and Nairobi, and be disregarded in such a way for the staff after all we've been through were the most disrespectful situation and worst customer service we have ever faced with an airline.In addition, I faced a similar situation on my outbound flight from Kigali to Mumbai, which was cancelled when we were about to board, at the gate. At that time, I spent five hours at the airport waiting for information, just to be told I should go to a three-star hotel and wait to hear about my new flight. I then missed my connection from Nairobi to Mumbai and was only able to arrive 1 day later.This is the third flight I take (from 3 bookings) with Kenya Airways that gets cancelled or delays for several hours. It reassures us that we can't trust the airline, the words of the employees, and the company policies, some mentioned on the Kenya Airways website, such as ""We will rebook you to next available Kenya Airways flights or an alternative airline to your destination shown on the ticket within a reasonable time"", ""During flight delayed or cancelled, we will provide you essential service such as accommodation, meals, ground transportation as the situation requires.""I couldn't be more frustrated and tired with Kenya Airways services and communication, but I expect an answer and AT LEAST a good compensation for all my husband and I had to go through.",,2024-04-16T19:47:13.000Z
"3 bookings, 3 flights cancelled, no support","Mine and my husband's flight was supposed to be on April 16th, 2:40 AM from Mumbai to Kigali. At 09:30 PM on April 15th, we arrived at the airport and saw that the first flight (to Nairobi) had been delayed 9 hours, and I would now depart at 11:45 AM on April 16th. We were already frustrated, as we would miss our connection to Kigali and have to arrive one day later. However, we tried to be patient and wait for the hotel/transport/food voucher.  We waited for 4 hours at the airport, during which the Kenya Airways staff said they were ""trying to book a hotel"", but NOTHING was provided.

Enjoyed flying with Kenya Airways,"Enjoyed flying with Kenya Airways , flight was smooth .",,2023-02-18T16:45:05.000Z
KENYA AIRWAYS' NEGLIGENCE & INADEQUACY,"I had booked my flight ticket to depart  from O R Tambo International Airport - Johannesburg, on the 2nd of May 2023 at 1:15 AM, having a booking reference number of 4C8N8P and bearing a total cost of $488.92. The intended flight in which my economy class ticket was booked, was supposed to take off from the O R Tambo International Airport - Johannesburg, having flight number 765. I had booked the above-mentioned flight ticket through the website: FlightHub, which is a flight ticket aggregator website on the internet. I had successfully booked two way flight tickets to and from Johannesburg through FlightHub and the airline I booked the flight tickets on were Kenya Airways, and I successfully arrived in Johannesburg on the 19th of April, 2023. Upon my arrival, I wanted to reschedule my return flight, for which I started communicating with the Kenya Airways Customer Service Department. My first attempt to communicate with the Kenya Airways Customer Service Department was on the 30th of April, 2023 at 9 AM, which is before a period of 48 hours from the intended departure date and time. I repeatedly tried contacting the Kenya Airways Customer Service Department from 30th April, 2023 till 2nd May, 2023, even after the departure of the flight from O R Tambo International Airport - Johannesburg, but with no luck. Its now two weeks later, and I still do not have a return date nor ticket. My intended changed date was 9th May 2023, and I had to fly with another airline on 23rd May 2023, and at Airport I was given overstay ban of 1 Year. They messed up my plans for 14 days, and that cost me lot of extra unplanned expenses, and also became sick because of emotional damages. I email and open an a support ticket on their website but they have been so slow. I had no other choice to engage in legal actions against Kenya Airways for all the damages caused to me. They have a mediocre and dumb call centre response, an inadequate problem solving skills. I do not recommend this airline. Imagine to the point, I had to book another return ticket with a different Airline, because they never resolved the matter. They will have to pay for all my expenses.",,2023-06-19T17:53:44.000Z

Slap yourself on the face before booking to fly with Kenya Airways.  Then book another airline. You will thank yourself you did,"So--- where do I start? This is our first time flying with Kenya airways & will be the last. We are in Africa for a 25th anniversary trip & we were flying (KQ flight 471) from Kigali to Nairobi on 19th Jan 2024. We arrived at the airport at 7 am for the 9.10 am flight. Minutes after take-off, the pilot announced that we were returning to the gate, as a ""door latch wasn't closing"" & they needed to have it looked at. At around 10 am, after half an hour sitting on the flight, they said we needed to get off & they would give us an update. After sitting around for 3 hours, at 1 pm, we were told that we would be put on a flight at 7 pm, and that they were going to bus us to a hotel for lunch & to wait. We had a flight to Zanzibar at 6.30 pm on Jan 19th, but since we weren't even supposed to leave Kigali till 7 pm, we knew we would not make our connection. The Kenya Airways rep assured all of us that all of us would ""automatically"" be booked onto connecting flights & we didn't have to worry about a thing. Since matters were out of our hands at that time, We left with our fellow passengers & were taken to a not so nice hotel, where we were told to have lunch & wait for an update.At around 5 pm, the reception informed us that Kenya Airways had updated them that we were no longer going on the 7 pm flight, but were going to be out on a 3.40 am flight to Nairobi, the next day, January 20th. It would be more 17 hours past our original departure time, but we had no option but to wait it out, as our bags were still at the airport.Somehow, we all made it to 1 am at night, when a bus arrived to take us back to Kigali airport. Upon arrival, we were told that the 3.40 am flight(KQ 479) was delayed till 4.40 am. To make things even more chaotic, our connecting flight to Zanzibar(KQ 490) was also already delayed from 8 am to 11.20 am. I'm writing this as I sit at the airport, hoping to finally get to Zanzibar today. The total flight time from Kigali to Nairobi & Nairobi to Zanzibar is 3 hours or so, and thanks to Kenya Airways, we have already spent 27 hours at the airport & the hotel & we still don't know if we will actually get to Zanzibar today. And if our bags will be on the Zanzibar flight. Time will tell.It's only now that I'm reading all the terrible reviews of Kenya Airways. We experienced the terrible customer service first hand, with agents not having any replies to questions, absolutely no apologies from any staff for the agony caused, and long lines of angry customers at every counter. The horror stories are real. Avoid this airline like the plague, if you value your peace of mind. Anyone can understand one aircraft having ""operational issues"". But from what we saw and experienced, cancellations, delays, no accountability & no apologies are a daily way of life for Kenya Airways. How can an airline get it so wrong, so many times?Bottom line-RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN, FROM KENYA AIRWAYS. YOU WILL THANK YOURSELF YOU DID. IF YOU STILL BOOK WITH THEM AFTER READING ALL THE TERRIBLE REVIEWS- well, you were warned.",,2024-01-21T06:51:01.000Z
"Kenya Airways is the worst airline that I have ever flown with, and I fly a lot!","I departed from Amsterdam with a KLM flight to Heathrow where we connected on a Kenya Airways flight to Nairobi.On departing Heathrow, we were informed that we were not able to drink the water on the plane as someone had contaminated the water tank by throwing something into it.After one hours of flying to Nairobi, we were informed that we would have to return to Heathrow as the flaps on the airoplane were not working. More than another hour back to Heathrow, dumping fuel and still noting to eat or drink.We landed and were requested to remain on the plane whilst the engineers determined the issue. we were told to remain on the plane as they could fix the issue, then we were told that we needed to disembark as they could not fix the plane, then we were told to remain on the plane as they could fix the plane and eventually after more than three hours we were told to disembark and meet in the baggage collection area where we would be put on other flights. Still nothing to eat or drink.The Kenya Airways staff leave and we follow. They enter the airport. We are stopped by immigration authorities as we were in transit and therefore did not have visas for the UK. I am denied access and the immigration officials try to call Kenya Airways but nobody answers. This goes on for hours. Eventually I am able to get hold of Kenya Airways in Nairobi and explain the situation. Kenya Airways tells the immigration officer that they will issue a ticket for me to fly via Emirates to Dubai and connect to Nairobi from there on the 20h00 flight. They do not send the paperwork and I am unable to board the flight.Again multiple calls to Kenya Airways in Nairobi and am out on a 22h00 Emirates flight to Dubai. Am assured my luggage will travel with me. Still no offer of a drink, a meal, a shower. Nothing, despite being at KQ mercy for more than 14 hours already.I land in Dubai early morning and am expected to sit there until midday when I connect to Nairobi on an Emirates flight. It is now almost 30 hours that I have been travelling and other than the meal on the flight, Kenya Airways have not provided a meal. a drink or a shower - no lounge access, nothing! I managed to purchase drinks from a vending machine at Heathrow.I land at JKIA and... my luggage is missing. It is now Thursday night and Kenya Airways has no idea where my luggage is. Calling Kenya Airways all day Thursday and they are unable to tell me where my luggage is. Eventually Friday night my luggage is delivered to me.I missed all my important meetings on Thursday, did not use the bed I paid for for the Wednesday night and had to go to a meeting on the Friday morning in clothes I had been wearing for a third day.I went to the Kenya Airways office and met with staff - all they were prepared to offer me was a Kenya Airways voucher to the value of USD165 for the room that I paid for and did not use. No attempt to compensate me for all the stress and inconvenience, the meetings missed (that we the actual reason for the trip) the delayed luggage or anything else.I will not accept an USD165 Kenya Airways voucher. It is a disgrace and an insult and my self respect is worth more than that. Kenya Airways thinks it can treat its clients with impunity.I recommend all travellers stay away from Kenya Airways unless you want to risk a ruined vacation or business trip, with repeatedly delayed or cancelled flights, lousy foods and lost, damaged or delayed luggage, with no customer service.",,2023-05-24T20:15:06.000Z
Disappointing Experience - Inflexible Name Change Policy,"I am writing to express my extreme disappointment and frustration with the service I received regarding my recent booking with your airline. Despite my best efforts to seek assistance, I was met with an inflexible and unsatisfactory response concerning a simple name change on my E-ticket.Booking Reference Number: 706-2304685247I made the reservation in good faith, ensuring that all the information I provided was accurate. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, I had to change my travel plans, and in doing so, I realized that my name on the E-ticket was not correctly entered.I immediately contacted your customer service to request a name change to rectify this honest mistake. To my dismay, I was informed that the airline's policy does not allow any changes to be made to the passenger name on an E-ticket, regardless of the circumstances or supporting documentation provided.This rigid policy is deeply concerning, as it fails to take into account genuine situations like mine, where a simple name correction was needed to ensure a smooth travel experience. It is disheartening to see that the airline prioritizes strict adherence to policies over customer satisfaction and reasonable accommodations.this incident has left me feeling undervalued and unheard. As a result, I felt compelled to share my experience with others, which is something I hoped to avoid. However, it is crucial that potential customers are aware of the lack of flexibility and understanding they may encounter when booking with your airline.I understand that policies are in place for a reason, but I strongly believe that exceptions can and should be made when necessary, especially for minor changes like this. A more customer-centric approach in such situations would go a long way in building trust and loyalty among passengers.I sincerely hope that my feedback will prompt your airline to reconsider its stance on name changes and adopt a more compassionate and accommodating approach in the future.Yours sincerely,",,2023-08-03T19:54:52.000Z
"“WORSE EXPERIENCE EVER, TRY TO AVOID AT ALL COST”","It all started on 11th January 2023 we (I Mr. EGEJURU RICHARD and my family) flew from Dubai to Lagos after a transit stop at Nairobi through (Flight KQ311 and KQ532).At Dubai airport Jetway/Loading Bridge, the airways Staff took my hand luggage which contains important items, and gave me a tag, they said; I will receive my bag at arrival.On arrival at Murtala Muhammad Airport, many of us waited for our hand Luggage until a staff came with a list and told us that all the hand luggage that was collected was not loaded in the airplane, and he collected our details like Surname and the gate bag tag(XH964321) and mobile number, which they can contact us with, and that we should call by 6pm next day, which I called as instructed and was told that the bag didn't arrive with the next day plane, it is so annoying that after all these days one month gone, yet my I have not seen my hand luggage.We all knows that must time our valuable things are kept on our hand carrier, all my clothes and many other items in my hand luggage as someone going for vacation till my vacation date elapsed and I return back to UAE as I have residence visa my hand carrier is still no where to be found. I have sent several emails to Kenya Airways Guest Support on customer.relations@kenya-airways. com with no meaningful reply only from their automated response confirming to receive my mail several times, with no effort at all.This is the worst airline I have ever experience ever since I have been flying from different countries, even for the air hostess to give water to a passenger is a big deal, they will come with a very little disposable cup and you request to fill it, it will be like you are demanding for too much.I paid approximately 1,500 Dirhams for my TV handling and luggage, they couldn't handle it carefully I received a broken screen TV at Murtala Muhammad Airport which is so annoying after all the stress.Now am back to Dubai without seeing my hand luggage, what is the need of my vacation as I couldn't get all the items I have packed for my vacation, if possible I would've even cancel my returning ticket and fly with another airline, this is so painful and unacceptable, Kenya Airways are supposed to pay for",1,2023-02-12T07:01:03.000Z
They cut too deep!😒😞😔😟😕🙁☹️😣😖😫😩🥺😢😭😤😠😡🤬🤬🤬🤬,"I don’t even know where to start because I’m still trying to find a sense of peace from the pain I feel today because of KQ.See my husband and I have been loyal customers of KQ for a very long while now. Our two kids have been using the airline since year 7 and year 8 and now uni whilst our daughter is matriculating respectively. And in these years we’ve had many mishaps from cancelled flights to tampering and theft of personal products but nothing that can make us run a mile away. This year has been another story all together 3 times my underage daughters flights have been cancelled or changed without prior warning and when contacted I get the same we have no other alternative.Today it hit the fan because I’m scheduled to attend my daughters graduation tomorrow from 9.30am to 1.30pm. Tuesday night I got an email notifying me that they had cancelled my scheduled flight and rebooked me onto another that would arrive even earlier than the original flight. That made me super happy because I would have time to relax as opposed to the original where I would have arrived late at night and get little sleep.Move forward to today, I got to the airport at 1am and checked in, before doing the documents check I noticed that my boarding pass was showing something completely different from the ticket itinerary they sent me after they did the rebooking. Now I have to fly at 8pm because they did another change without letting me know and even after I had specified to the customer service lady that did the first change before notifying that as long as I get to Cape Town before the 15th I’m good with the change. She assured me I’d be reaching today (14th) at 3.55pm. As did another lady confirm I’d be landing in Cape Town on the 14th at 3.55pm.I notified the ground flight attendants of the mix up and their superior tried her level best to get me on the flight but to no avail. No one from the Head office picked up the phone when the Grounds supervisor kept calling countless times till the phone rung off on all times. I was at the airport this morning till 20minutes after the plane took off without me.I have my hotel booked, paid for the duration of my stay and it’s non refundable. My daughters Valedictory Ceremony is tomorrow and I’ve been rescheduled to get to Cape Town 5minutes after the ceremony finished. I shed tears at the airport because this hurt too much and I didn’t want to be mean to the lady on ground as this was not her doing but the doing of HQ.Not too long ago I finally managed to get through to their customer care line and requested for an alternative to be found via Johannesburg. They told me BA is full, Comair is not operating and the other two solutions is to stick to the newly changed ticket or unfortunately find my own means to get to Cape Town from JHB. I pointed out that I paid in full to get to Cape Town and surely because this whole muck up is their fault and they need to take responsibility for the cost but she said no unfortunately we can’t.Now I’m scheduled to get to Cape Town after my child valedictory has already finished. As I’m writing she’s been on the phone with my husband crying because she will be the only child without any of her parents or any family cheering her on. I’m always the one with the solution but for once I’m left without one I can cling onto to make this work. I’m very hurt and disappointed and for the first time in all the series of mishaps this has tainted my view of Kenya airways. What they have put me through can never be undone, my child’s cry hurts me so much and also because of lack of effort to ensure a loyal customers expectations are met.I emphasis that Kenya Airways need to reevaluate their Customer Service system because they just hurt one of their loyal and I’m sure there are many more out there but I speak for myself and over what I’ve been subjected to today (14/10/2021).You cut me too deep and it can never be undone ever.MNR",2,2021-10-14T06:09:58.000Z
Strong Displeasure: Denial of Boarding and Inadequate Refund,"I am writing to express my utmost disappointment and frustration regarding the recent incident that occurred on 23 June 2023 when I was denied boarding on my scheduled flight from Johannesburg to New York via Nairobi. The reason for this denial was an error in your system that displayed my surname as my middle name, despite my correction during the check-in process. Despite the correctness of my first name, other middle name, and passport details, I was unjustly denied the opportunity to embark on my journey.I cannot begin to emphasize the inconveniences and distress caused by this situation. It is beyond comprehension that such a minor discrepancy in my name, which was clearly inputted correctly by me during the check-in process, would result in the denial of my rightful passage. This error not only reflects a lack of attention to detail on the part of your staff but also highlights a blatant disregard for customer satisfaction and basic human empathy.Moreover, the fact that your proposed resolution is only a partial refund is entirely unacceptable. I entrusted Kenya Airways with my travel plans, assuming that I would receive the service I paid for. However, I was met with an incredible display of incompetence and was forced to endure the distress and financial burden resulting from your system's error. It is only fair that I am fully compensated for the inconvenience, emotional distress, and financial losses I have incurred as a result of this incident.As a result, I now find myself in a position where I must think carefully before booking with Kenya Airways again in the future. The trust and confidence I once had have been significantly undermined. It is disheartening to consider that such a simple error in your system, combined with an unsatisfactory resolution, can result in a loyal customer losing faith in an airline they have previously relied.I implore you to take immediate action to rectify this situation. I expect a prompt and comprehensive response, addressing the following concerns:1. An explanation for the systemic error that led to the incorrect display of my surname as my middle name in your system, despite my correction during the check-in process.2. A sincere apology for the distress and inconvenience caused by your staff's decision to deny me boarding based on this error.3. A full refund of the expenses incurred for the denied flight, including any additional costs resulting from this incident.4. Assurances that measures will be taken to prevent such errors from happening in the future and to ensure that customers are treated with respect and fairness.Failure to address my concerns and provide a satisfactory resolution will leave me with no choice but to escalate this matter through appropriate channels. I will not hesitate to share my unfortunate experience on various public platforms, warning potential travelers about the poor service and disregard for customer rights demonstrated by Kenya Airways.I trust that you will understand the gravity of this situation and take immediate steps to rectify it. I eagerly await your prompt response.",,2023-07-05T10:34:49.000Z

Unforseen circumstances & lockdowns, I understand BUT their service is putting salt in the wound when they confirmed a departure.  1st flight I received a cancellation email, the other 5 flights I called a day before to check cancellation.  I held the line for 2+ hrs, money wasted & they said they cancelled the flight a week ago.  Then I rebooked & told me to add more money, which I did.    That went on until I was immune to their lies.  Why give me you word when you doubt?  I lost 2 tickets from my connection flights, emotions in-between were priceless.  I literally begged them to not forget me when there was flights going, they forgot me & 1 consultant said they were not flying i must check in 2 weeks, following hour I called to cancel, the another one said 1st flight went already.  It came to a point whereby I could not believe the level of ugly service they gave.  I called my family and told them I dont know when I will arrive home, no months / date estimation.  You cant trust what they say, ever.  No one should experience that, esp when you pay.  I dont wish for anyone to EVER go thru that!!

"If you can avoid flying with them, you should!","I have heard a lot of negative feedback about Kenya Airways, which made me hesitant to book with them. However, last year I gave it a try and I wish I would not have considered them at all.Their service on ground is horrible!We booked a flight from Entebbe, Uganda to Zanzibar to spend a few days at the beach after our long safari. As we were at the airport for our 16:00hrs flight, we were informed at the check-in counter that the flight from NBO to ZNZ was cancelled. That can happen, but we have not received any information from KQ - nor email or message, nothing! The next flight was leaving leaving Nairobi was 7 hours later! However, there was nothing we could do. We took our flight from Entebbe to Nairobi, where we spend 7 hours at the airport. As we reached Nairobi, we went to the service desk to ask if there would be any compensation for cancelling our flight short notice without even informing us. After 1 hour of intense discussion, we received a voucher for the restaurant. Well, we thought ""better than nothing"". As we set down at the restaurant, we has the choice between rice and a (very tasteless) chicken stew, rice and a beef stew and rice and vegetables. We could not even order a simple salad from the menu with the vouchers we received from the service desk. Very poor! After 7 hours at Nairobi Airport, we finally continued our journey to Zanzibar. We arrived in the middle of the night with an 7 hour delay, our booked airport transfer was of course not waiting for 7 hours at the airport, so we had to find our way to our hotel by our selves.On the way back, we arrived in Entebbe without our luggage. The luggage cam then 7(!) days later, though there are several flights service this route a day!We complained, but no response to our emails was ever received. Calling the service center was also without any success. After a while we gave up.This airline is really ridiculous. You should avoid flying with them, if you can!",,2019-08-19T13:56:02.000Z

A delay of twelve and a half hours and lost luggage.,We had a delay of twelve and a half hours and a few other disruptions:1. Original flight KQ256 was canceled without a reason given.2. The next flight KQ262 was suposed to leave at 22:45 but we did not leave till 1am. During this time we sat on a fairly warm plane with little information about what was going to happen.3. When we finally arrived in Antanarivo we found out that our luggage was not loaded onto the plane. Eventually we got told it might be on the next flight and arrive at 15:00 but that flight was also delayed and we only recieved our luggage after 19:00. Again the information provided on the screens or from the personal at Kenya Airways was lacking.,,2019-04-24T18:20:47.000Z
Don't ever fly with Kenya Airways,Don't ever fly with Kenya Airways - they are untrustworthig and take no responsibily at all for their own mistakes.On April 2 2018 we were not allowed on our booked and payed homeflight back from Dar es Salam to Denmark. We were told the ticket was cancelled due to no show on our outbound trip.On the way out our regular flight from Nairobi to Dar was cancelled and Keyna Airways staff showed us to a new plane - hardly our fault.Keyna blames KLM that we tavelled with from Denmark to Amsterdam but it clearly is KQ's fault - which they actually also admitted. However they claim KLM hold the money. Again that hardly is my fault. The whole thing cost me USD 2.000 for a ticket back to Denmark and now after fightning with the company for 10 months I give up. I will do what ever I can to tell the story to friends so they never ever fly with KQ.Its a lot of money for me to have lost and I still cant believe that a so called professional company will allow their customers to end up in such a mess.My contact person Ahlaam Ganzel in KQ has been of no help at all,,2019-02-12T11:18:14.000Z
Kenya Airways – Factor in Ransom Payments,"I was super excited to travel to Zimbabwe and see Africa for the first time and got the perfect excuse when one of my closest friends from college planned her wedding in Harare. My outbound flight on American Airlines was cancelled due to weather, leading to me missing my connecting flight on Kenya Airways. While this was unpleasant, no one can control the weather, and AA helped re-book me on a later Kenya Airways flight into Harare, Zimbabwe, so I made it on time to the wedding.After a few weeks of seeing Victoria Falls and making friends with lions, I got back to check into my flight back to the States with Kenya Airways. The attendant there helpfully let me know that I had been marked as a “no-show” on my outbound flight, and now my return ticket was cancelled as a result. After arguing that I clearly was re-booked on a later outbound flight, given my presence in Zimbabwe, and would very much like to return home, Kenya Airways told me I could get on the flight if I paid a “penalty” of $1200. As I had already paid for a round trip ticket, which typically include a flight home, I indignantly refused to pay for my flight a second time and wound up missing the morning flight. Two more flights back to the States came and went, and I missed all of those flights as Kenya Airways demanded ransom payments to let me out of the sweltering hot airport onto a plane. I racked up hours of international cell phone call payments with American Airlines customer service and my travel agent, who all let me know that Kenya Airways was not picking up the phone, and they were the only ones who could get me on one of their planes.16 hours later, having missed every single flight that day, I finally gave in and paid the $1200 “penalty,” or really, the ransom payment, in addition to the $1600 round trip ticket I had already paid, and Kenya Airways let me on the flight back home. For the privilege of nearly doubling the cost of my plane ticket, I also had a 17 hour layover in Nairobi, after which Kenya Airways told me my flight to JFK was overbooked. At this point I had resigned myself to the fact I had probably died and was in some new circle of airline hell, but fortunately Kenya Airways did one thing right and found a seat for me onto the flight back to the States, which I had paid for twice. All in all, I wound up spending nearly four days total in airplanes and airports, racking up international phone charges, and nearly doubling the cost of my Kenya Airways ticket.Kenya Airways, the Pride of Africa.",,2019-01-08T16:42:57.000Z
“Delayed” luggage - poor customer service,Flight from Paris to Nairobi. Lost both cases. After 6 days we got our cases back (damaged and broken) missed taking vital medication due to this and also clothes for safari which we needed.Refused to answer emails and phone calls just hung up on you when you asked a question.Offered $100 which is insulting after that was spent in just medication. We had lie and lie where my luggage was and when it was being delivered. In the end we paid someone else to collect the luggage as Kenya Airways were too incompetent to do that. Ruined our holiday and my 12 month planned engagement!Avoid this airline at all costs. We were 2 of 10 on our flight and we saw more when we returned to the airport!,,2019-01-08T14:47:25.000Z

Customer Service UNHELPFUL,"Customer Service line (online chat service) was really not helpful at all. Response time of the person on the other side was worryingly slow that I almost clicked out of the chat several times. On top of that, the responses which were given to my queries concerning my inability to check in online was to go check with the other airline (which is code-sharing a flight) and then come back to the Kenya Airways website and try again. However, I found that this was a really unacceptable response considering that the ticket was issued by Kenya Airways and not the code shared airline. Until now, my questions still have not been answered, and I am hoping that I will be able to check in tomorrow with a seat selected.Some feedback: A quick response, or acknowledgement that the message received would have been much better - regardless of whether or not the customer service agent had an answer to my question. This would have assured me that there was someone on the line.",,2018-12-16T05:47:50.000Z

Worst flight experience ever,"I can only recommend to anyone to avoid this airline. I would even pay a bit more, just to avoid Kenya. First, our flight was canceled and we were given no information of Kenya why. The next one went only 24h later. During this time, they provided us accommodation, but only two meals. When I asked for a third, they declined. When I said that I disagree, they simply said I could file a complaint to their main office.On board, our ordered special meals were missing. Once finally arrived, my bag was missing. They managed at least to get it to my hotel within 24h.When I wanted to introduce compensation claims (for the flight and baggage delays), they sent me from one office to another. Up to this date, the claims are still pending and I am not sure to get any form of compensation for the stress, energy and extra expenses.",,2018-09-05T14:33:28.000Z

Recommended African Airline,"Excellent african airline! Last year when I was volunteering in Victoria Falls and wanted to go on vacation in Cape Town for a week, I booked my flights with Kenya Airways. The crew were nice to the passengers, the seats were nice & clean, and there was enough leg space as well. Additionally, food and drinks was included in the price, which was fairly cheap (400 USD for a return ticket). Also, the flight was very comfortable, everything seemed to be sorted out well. The only issue was that the flight was delayed for an hour, but that is something you have to get use to when travelling around Africa.",,2018-06-24T19:19:28.000Z
Bad KQ Experience,"I have had several bad experiences with KQ, first time I was travelling from Nairobi to Addis Ababa, my bag was not delivered and I had to catch another domestic flight inside Ethiopia, I asked them if they could send me my bag to the address I was going to be, they told me no, they don’t do delivery. My stay was terrible due to this coz all my staffs, clothes etc were in that bag.My second bad experience is again with the same route, this time was flight from Addis to Nairobi, the flight was initially supposed to depart at 9:50am, I arrived at the airport at 7:30am, once arrived at the check-in desk agent told me there is a bit delay and advised that I shall go to final gate desk to confirm, at the final desk they told me the flight would depart at around 11am, but later changed to 12pm and finally they said it will be 13:30pm, I had connecting flight with boarding time at 14:55pm. I later missed my connection flight which was supposed to be 3:30pm, I had to go with 8:30pm flight, this was really terrible day for me. Overall experience was bad.",,2018-06-14T05:46:06.000Z
No concern for passenger clearly in pain,"I recently spent some time volunteering in Uganda and whilst I was there broke and dislocated my ankle quite badly. I needed to return home a few days earlier than planned, to undergo surgery, so rebooked a flight at additional cost and requested wheelchair assistance.Upon arrival at entebbe airport, then seemed unaware of my situation but did sort out some help. I also asked if it would be possible to be upgraded if there were spare seats in business class as it was important to keep my leg, which was in a cast, elevated as much as possible and particularly during a flight when it may swell more.The check in desk confirmed there were seats but that they couldn’t upgrade me there but that it should be possible in Nairobi where I would change to take an 8.5hr flight to London.At the gate in Nairobi I once again asked if it would be possible to sit in business class so I could elevate my leg. The man on the desk said that he couldn’t do anything without invoicing me but it was his attitude rather than refusal that really annoyed me. He was completely unsympathetic, laughing at me and treating me as if I was just trying to get some free perks. I was clearly in pain and the most annoying thing was that the flight was actually half full. As a goodwill gesture he’d ‘upgraded’ me to the seats with more legroom but as I explained to him when he did so, that would not help as there was nothing to rest my leg on, so it was still dangling down, putting pressure on the ankle and causing swelling. This seat was also very awkward to get in and out of due to the way the screens came out of the seat from the side and had no additional room to the side as the armrests were fixed. However, it did provide me with a great view of the business class section which was virtually empty, and I was galled to see there were several passengers in economy with at least 4 seats to themselves, enabling them to lie down for the entire flight and had they so wished to elevate their leg!  At no point had the man on the desk mentioned that there were many spare seats which would have enabled me to elevate my leg quite comfortably, despite me explaining the issue. None of the air hostesses expressed any concern for my situation throughout the flight despite my obvious discomfort and attempts to create a platform from bags and cushions to rest my leg on.Whilst I understand that other people have paid for the benefit of a business class seat, I felt that in extenuating circumstances such as this, particularly where it is a clear DVT risk, the airline could have made a goodwill gesture to ensure their passenger’s wellbeing and comfort. Had they done so it would have been a positive PR exercise for the company but as it stands I will not be recommending them to others and certainly won’t be rushing back to travel with ‘the pride of Africa’ any time soon.It topped off a disappointing end to what would have been a fascinating trip, but has left a sour taste in my mouth for this particular airline.",,2018-05-26T08:35:26.000Z

No notification,"No notification, no assistance, below budget quality with high priceFlew them from Capetown to Kilimanjaro.

We try to address at airport but are told nothing to be done here. At the next stop we have to exit security and are passed around and eventually argue to get in a little earlier but we don't even get to discuss options and communication is very unclear.Long story short it ruined the whole day and took several hours extra in which I was out international phone fees, personal transport since we missed the group transport, and a lot of stress I was going to miss my mountain climb start. In the end I made it albeit sleep deprived.My issue is this was not weather or mechanical- it was merely them diverting the plane to another location.Their notification is horrible- I was NEVER notified but rather had to happen upon it on a boarding pass.

Never again,Flew with Kenya airways last year in October.Unfortunately our flight was delayed because of the fog . Even though I admit they're was some fog it didn't seem to bother other flights as they all left. Next morning we got on the plane quite empty I must add only to be told after two hours fog had stopped the flight .Once again other flights barr ours left on time.We then caught the same flight 24  hours later which seemed to accommodate our flight and the ones on this flight. They saved a fortune there. The only funny side was Clare balding was on our flight and she wasn't amusedKenya airways used the fog as an excuse to save money and when we complained back home we were treated shoddily and received no compensation even though we lost a day off our holiday.Suffice as to say we won't be using Kenya airways again and I'm guessing neither will Clare balding,,2016-07-02T10:26:21.000Z
