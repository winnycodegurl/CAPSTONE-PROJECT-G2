Without an efficient method to analyze this feedback, the airline may overlook critical insights that could lead to service improvements. This project aims to address this challenge by systematically analyzing the sentiment of customer reviews, providing Kenya Airways with a clear understanding of customer perceptions and identifying key areas that require attention."
