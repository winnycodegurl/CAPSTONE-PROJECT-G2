"Recently I travelled for business from Cape Town to Entebbe (Uganda) with a layover in Nairobi (Kenya) return. On the flight to Uganda we flew in a Embraer 190 which is a smaller plane with 2 seats on each side (economy class) and on the return flight we flew with a larger Boeing 737 which had 3 seats on each side. Overall the food and drinks selection in economy class on both flights was good and filling enough for me, and the staff were very friendly and helpful. I also had more than enough legroom on each of the flights and the seats were comfortable. The in-flight entertainment in the Embraer was limited with 2 movies and a couple of TV shows (random bundled episodes of different shows per genre) with some music also available. On the Boeing there was a lot more content available however the sound quality was bad - I could barely hear even with the sound on its loudest setting. On our flight to Uganda we had a stop at Harry Mwanga Nkumbula Airport (Zambia) at which point I was automatically upgraded, for free, to Business Class. As you would expect, the seats were a bit more comfortable and there was more legroom available. Also, the selection of food and drinks was much better. I am not sure if I would pay the amount they are charging for Business Class, however I enjoyed the experience. Overall I am quite happy with my experience and will definitely fly with them again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/22/df/a3/7c/dewald-r.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dewaldr,Dewald R wrote a review Nov 2022,Dewald R,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",2336 contributions,198 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Entebbe,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r870188817-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Cape Town to Uganda via Nairobi and Back,Date of travel: September 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Dear Kenya Airways ,

I am on my way to Zanzibar from Bangui, with an upgraded flight to *sky priority*. The flight plan was Bangui-Nairobi (27/11, with a technical stop in Douala). We choose to book confortable Crowne Plaza in nice Nairobi in between flights. Then Nairobi-Zanzibar (28/11, ETA 9H30).

Arriving in Douala around 2pm we stayed grounded.
First we got explained that there was not enough jeta1.
Then, there was a technical issue and engineer needed instructions from Nairobi.
Then, he got the instructions but he missed a spare part.

We were disembarked around 5pm : begin of the nightmare. we had to wait till 6pm in a non AC room. Without any words of the crew or a glass of water.

Then, it was so disorganized for the passengers without CEMAC passports to get a visa : it took around 1.5 hours. I asked if we could already go and ask to the Kenya Airway office to which hotel we should go. The crew answered that we had to wait for all the passengers.

Finally the guy at the Kenya Airways office told us that we could go to Akwa Palace or Bano Palace. And that the spare part will not come before 2 pm the day after so that we ll not depart before 4pm the day after !

Then we finally got on a bus with a driver that yell on us (because nobody really knew where to go). We decided to took a taxi with my husband and go directly to Akwa Pamace (with nobody yelling at us during the transfer).

Arriving at Akwa Palace : the hotel told us that we should go to Bano Palace. Arriving to Bano ""Palace"" : it was so dirty, smelling bad and food was so bad... tje sheets were dirty. We got a second room that smells something like... cigarret mixed with humidity. Plus AC didn't work properly. Plus we got only one bath towel. No water in the room. It was so dirty that we went outside for dinner.

Anyway after all these I tried to call Kenya Airway' client support. I got an email during the night saying that our flight from Nairobi to Zanzibar was the 30/11 at 00.30 ... and our flight from Douala to Nairobi the 30/11 at... 20pm. PM. So we will do Douala-Nairobi after Nairobi Zanzibar, yep... everything is possible with Kenya Airways.
Wifi in hotel did not worked properly. From 4 in the morning I tried to reach via call & whatsapp... we also went to the airport around 8 am. We waited till 10.30 am before seeing someone from Kenya Airways. they were surprised that Akwa Palace refused us. Obviously it was too late for the Rwandair flight that could have bring us to Nairobi.

Around 1.30 pm we finally got a rebooking proposition (yep, we waited from 8 am to 1.30 pm in a non AC' airport). And remember, I did not sleep all night before that.

The proposition is a 21hours journey (3 flights) with Ethiopian Airline. In economic class, with refund (which I have to claim for! and perhaps you will refund within 21 to 30 days...). I asked to be booked in first class : refused. I asked to Ethipian to pay for the upgrade : too late!

Boarding tome : 1.20 pm. It s 2.30 pm and we are still waiting without any explanation of course.

So, guys, flying with Kenya Airways and you get :

- Degraded from sky priority to economic.
- Lost hotel reservations in Nairobi and Zanzibar.
- Lost 2 tours reservations in Zanzibar.
- Loosing time to make the claim.
- Loosing at least 2.5 days of Holiday.

IS THIS WHAT YOU CALL PREMIER WORLD ?",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/b8/default-avatar-2020-26.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VirginieAn,Virg A wrote a review Nov 2022,Virg A,,6 contributions,,Bangui - Zanzibar Island,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r869990160-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Horrible experience,Date of travel: November 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Absolutely appalling airline, never ever use it. It is incredibly unreliable and has terrible customer service. I was about to travel from Lilongwe in Malawi to Entebbe in Uganda via Nairobi, only to discover after a 5 hour drive to Lilongwe airport that the flight was cancelled because of a pilots' strike. This was at midnight. Received no email, nothing. Following day tried to get on another flight, could not; in the end the company i was working for had to book a new flight with Ethiopian following day. On my return flight from Entebbe two weeks later, my Kenya Airways flight from Entebbe was late and I missed my connection to Lilongwe. The airline then put me on different flight the following day and I had to spend one night in airport hotel in Nairobi. We had to wait three hours in airport terminal in Nairobi before they could be bothered to find our bags in the hold and we could be transferred to the hotel. Customer service was terrible. they could not even be bothered to bring us water. Avoid this appalling airline at all costs.

"Was travling from Kenya to South Africa last week. While i was heading to the boarding, the Airline Gate Employee , told me at 12:15 you are not cleared to take the flight to Johannesburg because you don't have a return ticket on our airline.

I have explained to him, I have a valid Visa to SA, I have a return ticket on another Airline ( and the fact that i already changed my return ticket because of the airline strike! last week) He didn't react and said well i know.

I told him please call me the Manager , he told me i will call him for you. Unfortunately he was pretending that he calls him until the plane took off and then he called the manager after I told him I will make a complain.

Now I have missed an important meeting today because of a decision an operator took with out referring to his manager. An I have waited for 9 hours in the Lounge for Clearance & Next Flight…

"My Thai husband and I were planning on traveling from Bangkok (where we live) to my home city of Cape Town. It would have been his first-ever flight for the Songkran break in 2020 and we booked Kenya Airways. It would have been my first flight with them as I have only ever flown with other airlines such as Etihad or Emirates. That was our first mistake. We were excited about the trip but then COVID hit and all flights were cancelled. We were given the option to rebook for later that year which we did, and booked for December, thinking that it should be better by then, our second mistake. When it did not get better and still there were no flights, we were given the option of cancelling and getting a refund or taking the voucher to use within two years. We chose the voucher (our third mistake) thinking that we were going to be able to use it. Fast forward to the beginning of this year. I have learned that Kenya  Airways no longer flies to and from Bangkok and they do not have a branch here anymore. I have been trying to get the refund of the vouchers. I have emailing back and forth with customer service for months and everytime they say they will check with the relevant department and get back to me but they never do. It was not our fault that COVID disrupted everything yet it seems that they have no one working at Kenya Airways because no one knows what the status of the refund is. DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS AIRLINE!!!! Very poor service and do not try to get a refund from them, you will lose your money.

"My wife and myself flew from Nairobi to Zanzibar after having finished a 2 weeks Safari in Kenya. The entire trip including Zanzibar stay of was pre-booked and paid for about a year ago, most of it, as the accommodations, non-refundable. Hence I boosted my travel insurance, included all “ifs” and bumped it to 15k USD, just in case.

However, all went very well except for one issue, and that was with Kenya Airways. The ticket to Zanzibar on Sept 18th with flight KQ 494 was booked and paid 9 months in advance, flight departure 18:20.
Long story short: that flight was cancelled for operational reasons as Kenya Airways said, the notification likely ended up in the SPAM as I never got it. The airline did not send out any SMS (that would come with a failure of delivery if not received) despite my number on record and permission to contact via phone. Hence I noticed the change 1 day in advance when checking the flight. More so, Kenya Airways had changed our booking to a flight next morning, despite an evening option available. Now, it’s not hard to guess that this would cause issues because barely any traveler, business or personal, does NOT have a booked agenda in post-Corona times. The other evening flight option however was fully booked by the time the problem was noticed as it turned out. Result: a lost expensive overnight stay in Stone town, and a dinner with friends.
Once arrived at the Airport on the original departure day, the customer service agent of Kenya Airways at the airport was extremely arrogant and very commanding as if the entire issue was our fault. Absolute exceptionally bad experience here on top of our interrupted vacation. While we did receive an voucher for overnight stay in Nairobi, the entire action and communication around it was not acceptable. I have Senator Status with LH and do fly quite a bit. Things go wrong and did so for me too, but this attitude of an Airline employee was new to us.

Kenya Airline declines responsibility despite the change for operational reasons and keeps sending me articles of the policy to say they don’t pay. Due to pre-booking, no refund for the lost stay by the hotel in Stone town or my travel agency and despite all bells and whistles in my travel insurance: if it is not force majeure but due the Airline's changes, the Airline is responsible. No travel insurance would apparently ever pay here.

So to all travelers: pay attention here, there is many other airlines I know with a lot better customer service and much more flexible policies when it comes down to issue. Everyone can do great when there is no problem, the value of an Airline shows when problems come up. The entire behavior of Kenya Airlines and in particular the customer service agent on top of all the hassle anyway is just totally unacceptable. This was the first and for sure last time. At least in and around Kenya and Tanzania try Precision Air as an alternative. As I still believe the originator of the problem will have to bear the consequences, I will continue and pursue ways to get my refund.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e9/bb/default-avatar-2020-65.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UWadlinger,UWadlinger wrote a review Oct 2022,UWadlinger,"Frankfurt, Germany",36 contributions,16 helpful votes,Nairobi - Zanzibar Island,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r863820469-Kenya_Airways-World.html,"When it comes to problems, the ""real service"" and quality shows",Date of travel: September 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We opted for an economy comfort seat for a surcharge.  Not sure what this offered  as it was still cramped and uncomfortable.  As it was chilly I had to ask for a blanket.  The entertainment system wasn’t fully functioning so I was relieved that I had my iPad.  We were served a breakfast…….overcooked egg, sloppy spinach and tomato with a stale bread roll.  4 hours on, when no drinks had been offered I began to feel dehydrated so rang the bell 3 times.  Eventually a stewardess attended and I asked were they going to serve drinks as I felt dehydrated.  She came back with a juice.  I then asked twice for a lager.  The steward looked at his watch and after a little while brought me one.  A few more hours went by and a packet of nuts was given out with a drink.  Since we had been on the plane for hours this was something.

This airline has been failing for a decade and it needs to be put down so it no longer disappoint customers. Paid almost $800 to fly 700 miles from Nairobi to Addis Ababa return. The flight was delayed by one hour from Nairobi and it seems like it will be delayed by three hours on the return leg. Worst than the delay is the lack of public information telling us about the situation and updates. There is not even a word of apology. I forgot to collect my laptop from the baggage check belt also at Nairobi and when I went back to enquire it was missing gone probably stolen by an employee to make up for their very poor pay. I will never travel Kenya airways again.

"Used Kenya Airways for a three stop journey from Heathrow to Amsterdam, the first leg of the journey was with KLM with no problems. The next leg was from Amsterdam to Nairobi followed by an onward leg to Dar Es Salaam. We were assured on more than one occasion that our luggage would go straight through from Heathrow to Dar Es Salaam. on arrival we went to collect our luggage only to be told it was still in Nairobi, eventually we managed to speak to a manager over the phone who told us our luggage would be sent out on the next plane and assured us it would be sent to our hotel which it did at 21:30, during that time we spent the day in our hotel room in the clothes we had been in since leaving home.
We left Dar Es Salaam early next morning for our safari holiday.
Holiday over and at Dar Es Salaam airport for our return flights this time to Nairobi then straight through to Heathrow. The Business class lounge was clean and well run, a chap by the name of Dough is worth a mention he was polite, helpful and did everything to ensure we were looked after.
The leg from Dar Es Salaam to Nairobi was quite short and went without a hitch.

The lounge in Nairobi was extremely poor, the food was low standard and running out , one passenger asked if there was more food coming and was shouted at saying ""it's coming man"" , I think the passenger was in shock As so was I, he wished me good luck and walked off.
Lounge tables were left uncleaned and dirty crockery from other passengers not cleared.
While in the lounge I took a shower to freshen up, the towel given to me was worn out and covered in holes and the water didn't regulate so I had a cold shower.
We boarded our aircraft for our final leg to the UK, not long after takeoff we were given breakfast, a little better than what you would expect in economy but not good enough for business class, this was really the last time we saw a stewardess until lunch which was no better, as they drew the curtains and stayed behind them, as we were just behind the bulk head, I did notice a stewardess through the curtain flossing her teeth.
Not once did anyone come around and offer water or a drink even though it was a long journey.
The toilets were not kept cleaned and the floors wet, there were also passengers coming through the business class from economy to use the toilets without being stopped, I don't want to sound snobby but this is what we pay a lot extra for.
The entertainment was also poor, no games and the films and programmes very old.
We have travelled on several business class airlines and none as bad as this, not even a smile from the disinterested staff.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/7c/default-avatar-2020-29.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E2114OFpeterk,Peter K wrote a review Sep 2022,Peter K,,15 contributions,1 helpful vote,Amsterdam - Dar es Salaam,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r861527851-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Worst ever,Date of travel: September 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"flight delays/changes with a compensation of just a meal voucher.

Completely appalled at the response by staff that they do not provide any extra services if the flight is delayed less than 8 hours.

Many passengers in the same predicament asked about lounge access and were told that the service is payable and will not be offered as compensation for flight delays/changes.

Kenya airways have been known for constantly rescheduling flights and leaving passengers stranded. Better care and compensation needs to be given to customers!!

Another downside is that the airport is always busy with limited seating and rest areas. Response from staff was to “wait around the waiting area for the 6 hour transit period”, but seating was extremely limited.

Even though the price of their flights are affordable, I do not think I will book with Kenya airways ever again.

"First things first... This airline has some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced. The food was horrific and was insufficient, the flight attendants were unresponsive and could not resolve issues with food that me and my family were having, and we were treated terribly. When booking a 3000 dollar flight across the globe, you'd expect more seat comfort and better service. I was sadly mistaken. In terms of comfort, amenities, service, and hospitality, I will surely say this is the worst airline I have ever taken. NEVER AGAIN.

"I travelled on Kenya airways flight KQ 508 from Nairobi to Accra yesterday.

I went forward and she pushed me back. She was rude and condescending and contrary to their own policy about masking, chose to speak to us without wearing one. I reported with her full name to the cabin crew. A push may be an accident of assault and that is unspeakable behaviour by an airline staff to a customer or anyone else.

The cabin crew on the other hand, were exceptional at their job and made the flight a great experience for everyone. They were attentive, made sure everyone was comfortable and well catered for and very courteous.

"Check-In at the KLM Sky Priority check in counters and subsequent security checks and passport control went very smoothly. The KLM Crown Lounge is also a lovely place to relax before the flight. However, the boarding process in Amsterdam was chaos. Sky priority protocols were thrown out of the window by the KLM ground staff and when asked why, the boarding agent rudely replied that they don’t have priority boarding for this specific flight. Fortunately a manager appeared and made some effort to provide a better service to the passengers at the gate.

Once onboard, the service was great. The plane is modern 787 Dreamliner and the cabin was super clean. Crew were friendly an attentive, the food out of Amsterdam was not the greatest for business class and the champagne had run out after the first welcome drinks. The return flight from Nairobi had a far superior meal service on the other hand. Seats are in 2-2-2 configuration which provides a huge amount of space. Unfortunately this layout is now dated when compared to AF/KL’s 1-2-1 layout on this route which offers direct aisle access for all J seats.

In Nairobi we transferred to a Precision Air flight down to Kilimanjaro. The experience was seamless and we even had time to visit the Pride Lounge which had an excellent breakfast on offer. Ground crew in Nairobi were professional and friendly and made one feel valued. Pity I can’t say the same about the KLM boarding agents in Amsterdam.

"The experience from start to finish was poor. Our routing was Cape Town / Nairobi / Zanzibar and then Zanzibar / Nairobi / Johannesburg / Cape Town. We checked in the night before our flight to Zanzibar and appeared fine. Fortunately, our travel agent was on the ball and checked the flights in the morning and saw that they had changed the flight to Nairobi and we were now going to miss the connection on to Zanzibar. The airline wasn't very helpful but our agent managed to get us on to a Precision Air flight from Nairobi to Zanzibar. There was no message from Kenya airways - apology - change - comment - nothing.

It meant a whole day in Nairobi instead of a few hours but we made the most of it.

Then when we arrived in Zanzibar, they had lost two of the six bags that we had checked in. In addition, the Kenya Airways check-in in Cape Town had mixed up all of our bags and luggage tags so we had to decipher which bags were lost by deduction. Despite the lady being quite sweet at check-in this was just unprofessional

We took the approach of chasing Kenya Airways, Precision Air (the last leg), the land agent on Zanzibar (Africa Stay) and ZAT the airport management company in Zanzibar. Of all of those Kenya Airways was the most backward.

Kenya Airways had both a web and WhatsApp channel for logging support issues and both were equally useless and there was no coordination between either. Neither gave us any useful information or made any positive contribution to us finding our bags.

Eventually Africa Stay and Precision each found and delivered a bag :-) and we got them on Monday after arriving Friday. Kenya Air sent me a message asking me for feedback on their support despite not knowing that the bags had been delivered to us. This was funny.

Again on our return, we checked in the night before and all was well. At the airport, they handed us boarding passes for the two flights Zanzibar - Nairobi and Nairobi - Johannesburg without saying any word about changes. We happened to check the boarding pass for the gate in Nairobi and my wife noticed that the time on the flight to Jhb was two hours later than scheduled (and on our original boarding passes that we had printed the night before). No acknowledgement from the staff when we dropped our bags. This meant a longer wait in Nairobi and missing our flight back to Cape Town on a different airline.

Lastly, every single Kenya Airways flight on the trip left late i.e. even later than the adjusted late time that they had already moved it on the schedule.

Clearly, they have very immature processes for operating both their flight schedule and their operations. You may get lucky but based on their 100% failure rate with our flights and luggage I would bet against it.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/46/9c/ef/dale-w.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/connecteddale,connecteddale wrote a review Jul 2022,connecteddale,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",180 contributions,50 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Zanzibar Island,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r847673836-Kenya_Airways-World.html,No clue how to operate an airline,Date of travel: July 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

They take forever to respond and it’s just ridiculous customer service. And get this, unlike any other airline when this happens, they are not compensating me for their mistake. Unbelievable.

"It was our 1st family holiday, no holiday for us for the last 3 years due to covid and a newborn. 2022 was the year for us to fly.
Me frantically trying to find tickets that would fit our budget but also thinking about Emirates and Qatar standards, Kenya Airways was last in the list even though they had a direct flight and especially reading recent reviews i was like ""No! not flying our national carrier""

Alas as budget was the main concern i closed my eyes and booked with KQ with a tear in my eye and said to myself ""as long as we reach safe""
Day arrived, 2 year old excited running all around the airport busy trying to hold her in the queue to check in. 1st sign of things were going to be ok is the staff at the KQ desk in LHR let us jump the queue, checked in quick and also kindly tagged our pram and told us we can have it up until boarding and can have it once we arrive.

We left on time.

Fast forward to mid flight, the crew were kind, and served and attended to passengers with smiles on their faces and seem to understand a crying baby. offered us food first (we'll come back to the food later).
Lights off in the cabin baby still awake, I decided to take her to the back where the crew was and just stand there and keep her occupied. The crew were singing to her offered juice and empty plastic glasses to play with. That made the flight seem to go very quick and got her tired enough to sleep, managed to get 2 hours of sleep and landing time seemed to reach quick.

When we reached the opened airplane door the cold Nairobi breeze greeting us, guess what, our pram was on the tarmac waiting for us to pick it up and stroll towards baggage reclaim and immigration no carrying, ""WOW!"" i said to my wife, ""so far so good. now our bags""
Cleared immigration and we reached baggage carousel already rolling and bags on their way, 10 mins later our bags arrive, 1,2,3,4,5 bags. yup all of them here safe and sound :)
As we get the bags on the trolley we here a cheerful ""hello!"" it was on of the cabin crew who kept our baby occupied in the plane. He asked if we were ok and if we needed any help but we were fine, he waved and wished us a good holiday.

Our holiday went great and now we are back and the flight back was equally amazing just sad we were coming back.

I felt KQ deserved a good review after being bombarded with negative reviews which I truly understand and I consider myself lucky, just credit when its due.

Hopefully KQ stays afloat and managed with care and love and looking after the employees as i feel its still truly the ""Pride of Africa""

"While I had no trouble on my flight from Nairobi to Entebbe, my return flight was a nightmare.  When I checked in three hours before the flight, they couldn't find my ticket in their system, despite the email confirmation I was showing them on my phone.  They were questioning whether I had bought my ticket from a legitimate source; I bought it directly from the airline. After quite some time, they sent me up stairs to the office where the staff called the call center who also could not find my ticket, the excuse being that it was not issued properly.  Supposedly they were fixing it and I was sent down to the ticket counter so I didn't not get stuck at secruity, since my flight was soon to board.  I waited even longer at the ticket counter again.  There were at least 4 other customers on this one flight who were also experiencing issues from no tickets despite purchase to no record of payment for baggage fees etc.  Every one had emails and reciepts of proof but since it wasn't in their system, they acted like there was nothing to do.  One woman had to pay her baggage fees again just to make the flight.Boarding time had started and I was panicking because I had to connect with three more flights to get home to the US.  Eventually someone told me they flight was delayed but not by how much.  When my ticket finally came through,  they offered no support in getting through passport control or security.  By this time, it seemed that the gate would be closing prior to departure before I could get there.  I did manage to get through before they started boarding but no one had the decency to let me know that I still had a bit of time.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeslieFox,LFox wrote a review Jul 2022,LFox,,3 contributions,4 helpful votes,Entebbe - Nairobi,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r846533945-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Terrible service--very stressful,Date of travel: June 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I haven’t even been on a Kenya Airways plane yet, but my customer experience with them is enough to never ever utilize them again.  First, they cancelled a flight I was booked on to Mt Kilimanjaro from Nairobi on June 19th (ticket purchased in March).  I get these days with COVID cancellations happen.  However, I received ZERO email notification that my flight was cancelled.   They automatically booked me on a flight the following day.   Had I not bothered to check the flight details on the Prepare For Your Trip email they did sent, I would have never noticed.   This would have completely ruined my Safari itinerary, so I had to cancel that ticket (of course Kenya Airway kept $100 as a cancellation penalty), and booked a flight with Safarilink (much more reliable).  I thought this might have been a fluke incident, but I am now writing this as I had the exact same situation happen to me on a flight I booked from Mombasa to Nairobi.   What would have been a several hour layover in Nairobi has now been cut down to where I will have to scramble to connect to my flight to London if any sort of delay occurs.   Again, Kenya Airways will send you all sorts of emails to upsell/upgrade but cannot have the common courtesy to send you an email indicating a flight has been canceled and giving you options for other flights.I’ve tried to contact them via phone, even my hotel has tried, and they cannot get anyone on the phone numbers and provided on their own emails.  This is my second time to Africa.  I love Africa.  However, and I hate saying it, every time when people ask me about Africa I tell them about TIA (This Is Africa), and be prepared for it.   They are ways about doing things here that will drive you insane.   So far on this trip Kenya Airways has become the epitome of TIA ass-backwardness.Do yourself a big fat favor and avoid flying with them.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasonhW6748QE,Jason H wrote a review Jul 2022,Jason H,,2 contributions,5 helpful votes,Mombasa - Nairobi,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r845618444-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Avoid this airline like it’s the plague.

"This is the worst airline I have ever flown. We booked roundtrip direct flights to Mauritius to and from Nairobi for our honeymoon. We planned to spend 7 days in Mauritius. The night before our flight from Nairobi to Mauritius, I was emailed (yes, emailed) at 11:19pm while I was sleeping to inform me that our flight time was to be changed from 1:00pm to 7:30am. As I was understandably sleeping at the time, I did not review this message until I woke up at 5:30am that morning. I was staying in Naivasha, Kenya at the time and so did not have time to make it to the airport. We immediately called due to the fact that we were going to miss our flight and no one was able to explain to us why this change was made so last minute to the flight schedule and why we were not informed ahead of time. I would think it would be common sense that an email in the middle of the night 8 hours prior to the new proposed flight time (for a now 7:30am flight) is insufficient notice. Even after speaking to multiple different Kenya Airways employees, I was never given a reason for the flight time change (just ""operations""). Ultimately we were rebooked for a flight late that day, but this was an indirect flight through Dubai, which didn't leave until 5:10pm and involved >16 hours of travel instead of what was supposed to be a 4 hour and 20 minute flight. Because of this, we were unable to check in for our hotel that we had paid for the night of our arrival and instead arrived the next morning, exhausted, having been traveling all night and transferring in Dubai in the middle of the night. To boot, the behavior of the passengers on the plane from Nairobi to Dubai was absurd. People were constantly standing up on the plane and blocking the aisle even after being asked to sit down by flight attendants. Kids were running around unrestrained and flight attendants had to ask over the intercom for parents to restrain their children multiple times. In the row in front of me someone was watching a movie on a tablet with nonstop gunfire with the volume on max and he was not using headphones. To top it all off, in addition to missing our first night of the trip, Kenya Airways also changed our return flight time, moving it up from 7:10pm to 1:40pm. This effectively compromised two different days of our trip (as we were unable to do much the morning of our departure and were unable to take advantage of the late checkout that we were qualified for at our hotel). On top of it all, our return flight was ultimately delayed by 40 minutes and the process to check in our bags took an absurdly long time, longer than it has ever taken for any other flight I have been on. We had all of our documents and it still took us >10 minutes to complete the check in process and this was after standing in line for one hour waiting for the check in desk. Bottom line, if you can avoid it, do NOT fly on Kenya Airways. You will absolutely regret it. We contacted customer service multiple times and they have absolutely refused to make amends or compensate us in any way for destroying our honeymoon.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arwilmington,arwilmington wrote a review Jul 2022,arwilmington,"Chicago, Illinois",6 contributions,4 helpful votes,Nairobi - Mahebourg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r845595636-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Missed Two Days of My Honeymoon,Date of travel: June 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We pay so much money yet get this kind of food

"Flying from Lusaka to London via Nairobi last month with Kenya Airways was a shocking experience. Pre-departure tests are no longer needed upon arrival to England. However, my instinct told me to check if I needed a PCR to transit through Kenya. The COVID information on the Kenya Airways website is extremely misleading. When I filled in all the details about my trip, it said nothing about a PCR test; however, when I spoke to an agent on WhatsApp they said I need a PCR test as I am not vaccinated (screenshots attached). Having to rush around Lusaka the day before I flew to London, I eventually got a PCR test.

I arrived at Lusaka Airport at 23:30 on Sunday and did not get my bags checked in until 01:10 on Monday (5 minutes before baggage drop off closes) due to the airline and staff's poor customs. I knew my bags were overweight and decided to pay the additional cost rather than repack. I was told that I cannot pay using card and can only pay in Kwacha or US Dollar. I had £100, which was roughly the additional cost and it took over 45 minutes for the staff to find out whether I could pay using British Pounds and inform me. The ATM I was advised to go to outside on the bottom floor of the airport was out of service and I had to run to the domestic airport (10 minutes from the international airport if you're in shape) to withdraw cash from the second nearest ATM. The total amount was 2066 Kwacha and when I presented 2100 Kwacha, I was told they did not have any change...

If you are travelling to Southern Africa, Ethiopian Airlines is a much better airline (THEY ACCEPT CARD PAYMENT) and I can see why more people prefer them over Kenya Airways.

"I was supposed to attend a pharma conference in Nairobi, flying out yesterday, but instead at the check in desk I was racially mistreated by the Asian staff members who are working for the Kenyan airlines at London Heathrow. I was denied to board in due to the electronic visa that was not complete due to the system being down and I spend more than an hour by trying to complete a simple electronic visa. The staff member were very rude, unfriendly, unprofessional and racist. I have seen then helping Asian passengers with electronic visa, because they were experienced the same.

The staff at the check-in desk are not supportive as such other airlines.

"After 5 days of following up via call/emails/tweets and WhatsApp messages Kenya Airways have to date not picked up the phone and called me once.
My luggage unfortunately did not arrive at destination and I have not been able to get an answer from the Kenya Airways despite my numerous calls and messages. The airline is completely disinterested and has shown a single ounce of empathy to the situation. The fact that I’ve been in a foreign country with absolutely nothing is of no interest to them. It’s basically a case of what would you like us to do about it. If there is a senior member at Kenya Airways who possibly see’s this review. Would it be possible to ask that you or someone at Kenya Airways pick up the phone and call me, let me know what is happening and what you are doing about it. I know this is to much to be asking but can you take 5 minutes out of your day to assist me. This incident has definitely changed my perception of your Airline and the service you provide to your passengers.

"Zero customer service.

Had an 9 hour delay on a 45 minute flight from Mombasa to Nairobi. Got one free drink after about 7 1/2 hours, charged us for a chocolate bar.

Our flight was the first due to leave at the start of the delay but then the last to actually leave, when it did actually leave they left our baggage in Mombasa and was told the next flight was 6 hours later. When I asked whether they would put us in a hotel until they brought us the baggage, they said it was our problem.

We weren’t able to leave the baggage area as if we did we wouldn’t be allowed to come back inside in the morning to get our cases therefore had to sleep on the carousel (there were two chairs sat on by security workers). It was only one kind airport worker who was walking through after about 4 hours that asked us whether we wanted any water (there were no shops or vending machines etc in there).

After all this we had obviously missed our connecting flight back to the UK due to their inability to recognise that the earliest passengers should be prioritised when flights get back going (and take their cases).

When we complained we were told that it was our problem we missed the flight and we would not be compensated a penny. So actually cost us another £1,500 to get back to the UK. Not even an apology. If they were a UK company they would have gone bust years ago with their attempts at customer service.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hulmey92,Ryan H wrote a review Jun 2022,Ryan H,"Bolton, United Kingdom",21 contributions,8 helpful votes,Mombasa - Nairobi,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r841767476-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Jokers,Date of travel: February 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I don’t leave reviews often, but in an age where airline quality is very clearly deteriorating, I had to give Kenya Airways some props. I had never flown with them before and chose them solely on their price point. They were the lowest other than Qatar Airlines, who I swore off several years ago after the worst flying (or possibly any) experience of my life #fyreflight. Anyway, my first impression was after my husband and I sprinted to make it to the gate and they waved at us to slow down and that it was okay and we made it etc. the kindness and understanding and congeniality shown was top tier. From when we boarded to landing, the service was impeccable. Served us extra wine and extra food (which were both surprisingly high quality). Plus the seats went back just a little further than what economy class normally does, allowing us to actually sleep comfortably for most of the flight. I will jump at the next chance to fly with this airline and you should too!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cnelso19,Meg N wrote a review Jun 2022,Meg N,"Pretoria, South Africa",3 contributions,,London - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r841158407-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Pleasantly Surprised,Date of travel: June 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I would walk the entire continent of africa before I fly kenya airways again. They delayed my flight 2.5 hours, so I missed all of my connecting flights to get back home to Washington DC. Then I was stuck in Nairobi for 24 hours, just to find out that they are now refusing to pay for my flight to Washington DC and they will only pay to fly me to Amsterdam (which was just the connection flight, I have no other reason to go there). After flying to Amsterdam, they told me that I had to pay for a completely new ticket out-of-pocket to get back to DC, even though the only reason I missed my original flight was because of Kenya Airways delays. All of the flights besides one were over €1700, so I had to book a €570 ticket through Turkey and Munich which added another 30 hours to my trip on top of the 12 hours waiting in Amsterdam between flights and the 24 hours in nairobi. On top of that, they did not send my luggage to Amsterdam, so I had to report my luggage as lost. I wish I was making this up. If their flights were on-time (or if they at LEAST paid for the next flight to DC), then this could’ve been handled so much better.

But for me to just get home (because of Kenya Airways delays that caused me to miss my connecting flights):
- took me 3.5 days (82 hours total)
- lost all of my luggage
- had to pay €570 out-of-pocket for a new ticket even though they were at fault for the delays and therefore the missed connecting flights

I would rather walk through the Sahara Desert, with honor, before I step foot on a Kenya Airways flight again. I have literally never written a bad online review before, but this airline is almost impressively horrific so I felt the responsibility of warning you all. It seems as though they did everything in their power to screw up everything. I’ve flown Ryanair around a dozen times and they can be late quite often, but Kenya Airways is run by the most clueless muppets on the planet.

I am convinced that Kenya has the best marathon runners because they arrive faster by running than flying. I seriously wish this was a joke, but I really had to share thus truth as a warning.

"The worst airline, my trip became the worst nightmare.Firstly as we were about to depart from Johannesburg, we were told our flight was delayed in Nairobi. When we landed in Nairobi around 9pm that's when the wrong turn horror movie started. It took the staff 6hrs to give us vouchers to go to the hotel and sleep. From 9pm till 2am that's when we went to the hotel. The hotel was nice 5 star The Hilton hotel. Before even sleeping after taking a shower the reception called and told us we will be fetched at 4 am. Already when they called it was 2.30 am. So we didn't even sleep we just sat waiting to be fetched. When we arrived at the airport around 4.20am, also problems to be checked in and given our passports back.

"Monrovia to Kigali through Accra and Nairobi 19-20 May 2022. The 2 aircrafts were both B737-800s in very good condition. I had to change my departure dates and it took me only 10 Minutes online - and was even free as it was a “Business Light” ticket. All flights were on time. Checked in online. Monrovia Airport is full of hustlers pretending to be from the airline but want tips and they are annoying, the airline should chase them away. Kenya Airways (KQ) uses a third party lounge in Monrovia which is small but good with courteous, proactive attendants. No champagne, but plenty of drinks and liquor. The local Club beer is good. Embarking easy, fast, not a single crosscheck from lounge to seat – what a pleasure. Onboard, welcome drinks were served. The seats were huge and well bolstered, reclining, new, and very comfortable. Could sleep. IFE or WiFi was only working on the last leg. No printed menus were given out, but the FAs asked each individual on food choices. My pre-ordered special sea food meals were all different, delicious, and served without reminders. Business Class was full after Accra, but I did neither feel cramped nor stuffy. FAs, all Kenyans, were good and caring – though maybe not world class. In NBO the Pride lounge did the job for me during the 12 hours’ layover. The last stretch to Kigali was with IFE onboard, champagne, and my beloved seafood hot meal, which KQ still offers (even in economy) in contrast to Qatar and Emirates who have stopped this service at is it not qualifying as “dietary reasons” to order. Luggage delivered quickly and in good order. Good value for money – will fly with them again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anderspp,Anders P P wrote a review May 2022,Anders P P,,23 contributions,6 helpful votes,Monrovia - Kigali,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r839221896-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Wonder about the many poor reviews?,Date of travel: May 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I give the whole airline 0!
Other than the horrible food the service from the staff members was absolutely horrible!
As a pregnant woman i need to walk around, so we decided to go around the whole plane as i was already seated for about 6hrs. We went through the business were the staff was preparing food. I admit it was the wrong time to be walking but we wouldn't haven’t know they were. Anyways due to to the we were stuck in the business class due to the trolleys blocking our path back.
This is were couple of staff members started to yell at us that we shouldn’t be at the business class and what were we doing there. I explained that im pregnant and need to walk. But some wouldn’t have it stuff irritated that we were there while they were preparing the food for business class. I told them we were stuck but they kept on saying why were we in business class like we were too broke to pay for it.
The whole mannerisms was disgusting!

"Flew Kigali to Monrovia over Nairobi and Accra on 8-9 May 2022. Flights on time. Checked in online worked well and got my BPs in airport swiftly. No luggage issues. Recognised as Skyteam elite. KQ staff came to me in lounge and, without request, carried my hand-luggage for me from lounge to the aircraft. No waiting time nor queues anywhere on the trip despite the flights were full or almost full. KQ delivers and have rarely let me down over the years.

Pearl Lounge in Kigali delivers but suffers from deprived views of airport runways.

First flight was on an Embraer 190 which is a lovely, roomy aircraft. Onboard, they allowed me to shift to an exit row as my original seat was mistakingly occupied by another person. The seat now offered was very nice - it would have costed me 50 USD if booked online. Drinks were generously provided. Appreciate KQ often have the Happy Hour concept where a request for a single drink most often triggers serving two. The wine in mini-bottles was acceptable, a South African “Stonedale”. I had requested seafood meal and I got it: it was a cold, tasty salmon sandwich. FAs were kind and effective. No IFE nor WiFi but on a 90 minutes flight its not an issue.

Transit in Nairobi Airport smooth and quick. It took me only 15 Minutes to reach the KQ Pride Lounge. I love this lounge, roomy and curvy designs with lots of nice sections. Had a god nights’ sleep after acquainting myself with a Niederburg rose-wine which superseded an alternative, Italian sparkling wine

The next flights from Nairobi to Monrovia via Accra were on their B737-800. Despite the flight was completely full (all seats taken in both classes!) the staff manage to care passengers well. No power outlet nor monitors, only WiFi and use of personal devices were possible. Special meal rendered to perfection. I also tried other dishes as I was offered. Drinks provided generously, again Happy Hour (order 1 get 2) occurred at least once. Slight delay as the stop-over in Accra took longer time as a lot of passengers disembarked before cleaning and loads of new passengers came on board – again the flight was full. Luggage in Monrovia came out quickly. Nicely done, Kenya Airways.

"Top 2 worst airlines, and not number 2. Where do I start? Okay…food? Absolutely terrible. They should consider changing the chef cause that flight from New York to Nairobi was painfully long and the food didn’t make it easier. The main meal with mash potatoes with two pieces of beef. The dinner was a Turkey roll which was absolutely dry and the bun was not fresh. Breakfast was sausages and potatoes. The most painful 14hrs of my life. The movies on board are truly the worst. Nothing new. Everything is old. Screens are outdated. Chairs are dirty. Oh they took an hour before departure. Even better, they changed my layover time from 2hrs to 6hrs. I’m beyond angry.

"Just about everything that can be wrong with an airline is wrong with Kenyan Airways. Their staff on the ground are incompetent, uninformed and sometimes unethical demanding things that are not legally required like “booking an extra covid swab” on arrival for $80. Technical faults cannot be repaired. Everything is run through the central hub in Nairobi and it simply does not care for its passengers around the world.

I had a flight from Nairobi to Dubai and was there with other people same time that were allowed to board but me and my husband were asked to wait for manager to come and check his passport if he can travel who was very snobbish even after being called severally.The customer service lady was not friendly at all as well.Later after keeping us there waiting we were informed we can’t board the plane we are late and the issue was not the passport anymore.Having used the same KQ lastweek with delay that was not even explained to me as a customer or emailed to be informed I did not understand how it went from passport to you are late while the same people we got there together boarded the same flight.The manager and Milca are the worst Kq staff I have ever come across their attitude is pathetic.We managed to book another airline same day and we boarded with no question related to passport and wondered if we are in the same airport and country since we had called immigration prior to confirm we can travel and was confirmed in both countries we can travel.That was our last trip and I am saddened that I had to go through that as a Kenyan what about the visitors?Check who you hire for service cause we were not in the wrong but we were treated like we were begging for a free flight.Luckily there are other options cause it’s not worth it anymore.Ivwouldn’t recommend this airline to anyone.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/fe/default-avatar-2020-58.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EWCN,Essy wrote a review Mar 2022,Essy,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",15 contributions,3 helpful votes,Nairobi - Dubai,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r832761983-Kenya_Airways-World.html,I AM KENYAN BUT I VERY DISSAPOINTED IN OUR AIRLINE,Date of travel: March 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Changed my flight by 35hrs+. Refused to provide basic customer services for cancellation and refund services.

I made a booking with travel2be on 24/12/21 Booking ID 19679051 from Lusaka to Dubai with Kenya Airways.

On 31/12/21 at 03am I received a cancellation email that was forwarded to me(I was CC and the email was actually sent to another gentleman regarding my flight) saying the 2nd leg of my journey had been postponed by 35hrs which would have left me stranded in Nairobi airport for the duration of that time. Within that time, my PCR TEST would have expired and I would have been unable to continue my journey thus leaving me stranded in an unfamiliar country.

As I was informed of this flight change at the last minute, I did not have enough time to make alternative arrangements with regards to accommodation in
Kenya and rebooking a PCR TEST.

Upon receiving the aforementioned email, I immediately cancelled my flights and requested a refund, in order to rebook a new journey.
My reason for refund was due to the unacceptable new journey I had been put on. My refund request has been denied 3 times, each time
without adequate justification. The changes were made by Kenya Airways and no fault of my own. Kenya Airways took no responsibility for the changes made to flight and kept refering me back to travel2be. Travel2be made made it increasingly
difficult to request cancellation.

I am extremely upset with the quite shocking and unacceptable service I have received so far from Kenya Airways. How can the company that made these last minute refuse to deal with my issue or accept my refund request!.
I would once more like to request for a full refund for my ticket due to the last minute changes made by Kenyan Airways to my
journey which would have left me stranded in a foreign, unfamiliar country for an unacceptable length of time.

"Phoned to change my flight and was told that it has been done. Two days later and having not received an email confirmation, I phoned back and they said that the agent I spoke to did not book and I would need to pay £89 dollars as the rates have gone up, pushed to fly on a different date and still there would be a 60 dollar penalty attached. Had the agent booked me in the first time I phoned, I would not be incurring these costs.

It took me two days of spending at least 4 hours on the phone to their international number where they are cautious not to phone you back as it will cost them and will happily put you on hold for as long as they want.

First day I spoke to an agent called Farida who said that they would book me into the flight but refer me to the manager to take off incurred costs, next referred to Grace the supervisor who swore to sort this out asap, waited till end of the day and phoned back and she was about to leave the office but said she has handed over to the next shift manager, nothing happened. Phoned again the following morning and got hold of Ann Gikandi who also promised to phone me back within an hour, after three hours of waiting, I phoned her back and she put me on hold to go speak to her manager called Beatrice and came back and said that they have reached a decision that I need to pay. Bear in mind that I have had to move this flight twice due to their incompetence.

As much as I am Kenyan and would like to promote a local airline, do not use these guys and It needs to be made public as they are awful and do not care at all.

This might be the first of many reviews I put out there but will be sharing this with local bloggers until something is done about their dreadful customer service.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/5a/default-avatar-2020-36.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/106hermank,Herman K wrote a review Mar 2022,Herman K,,1 contribution,1 helpful vote,London - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r831247371-Kenya_Airways-World.html,"Conmen, DO NOT FLY WITH THEM",Date of travel: March 2022,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

In the middle of the night when I got back to my hotel, this was 2 am in the morning, I saw an email with a subject “flight alert”.
Kenya Airways was letting me know about the “48 hours” connecting flight delay literally at the last minute. Miracilously managed to change this flight to another route at 4 am. Checked out, forgot stuff, but made it to my new flight at 7 am.

But this was not the end.

"I travelled Business Class, it was dreadful. Check in OK, then I was directed to a small, horrible lounge. What was left of the hot food had clearly been sitting there for several hours and looked revolting. There was no ice for drinks. No boarding announcement. Staff lost in their phone. I later realised I should have been directed to a larger lounge next to the departure gate
On boarding I discovered I had not been allocated my window seat as booked. Seriously annoying. The general experience is lowest common denominator.
Emirates and Qatar may be 20% more expensive but the are a million percent better
I deeply regret using Kenya airways. What's worse is the fact that I now have to make the return trip.

"To be clear, we never actually flew on KA. Like many people, we had to reschedule our June 2020 trip due to COVID. We were offered a voucher to be used the following year. Great, so far so good. When I went to rebook the same flight from and to the same destinations, the prices MORE THAN DOUBLED! What???!!!??? So I asked for a refund instead. All within the guidelines. Then it really all fell apart.

Since I paid for our tickets via a wire transfer instead of a credit card (never doing that again!) I was on my own to get a refund. I asked for a refund on 2/9/2021. After a year, and just shy of 100 emails, and 7 phone calls that I got hung up on when I asked for them to clarify, I finally got my refund. Today. 2/22/2022. Over a year!

I ended up having to threaten legal action after seeing an internal email that I shouldn't have seen. They stated that their ""empty promises have lost their effect."" That I ""needed to be managed."" That ""the customer has no idea of the word patience."" This was quite upsetting! They had just over $9000 of MY money and were trying to screw me out of all of it.

Buyer beware. This was the worst travel experience of my life.

However, we ended up going anyways using Delta and were treated well. The cost was only slightly higher due to stopping in Paris on the way there, but not enough to make the trip a no go.

"By the multiple bad reviews I already knew Kenya Airways was not a great airline. However, my multiple experiences with this airline have been even worse than expected.

In brief, the most serious problem stems from the customer service if you live in the USA. When you call, you wait a long time. Then, it is very rare that the person you talk to has the authority/ability/training to do anything you are requesting. Oftentimes, they say a supervisor will call you back. Trust me, they never will!

When you attempt to send emails to guest support or customer service there is a small probability you will ever hear back from them. I'm not confident they even look at the emails.

In one experience on a flight they double booked/double charged me, I made no less than 30 phone calls and sent no less than 25 emails. The result? Absolutely nothing!

Naturally, I would recommend avoiding this airline altogether. However, due to limited flight options in Africa, many times you have no choice in the matter.

Here a five tips:
1. If possible, always pick a European airline when coming into the Continent; never choose Kenya Airways unless it is the last option.
2. While in Africa, recognize that Kenya Airways is actually better than many of the other African airlines. This is hard to believe, but true. Here are the airlines in Africa that are better if you have the option: RwandAir, Ethiopian Airlines, and South African Airways.
3. If you a book a ticket for Kenya Airways, always do so on a 3rd party site (American Express, Expedia, etc.). Even though this sounds counterintuitive, there are oftentimes significant problems with the Kenya Airways payment website. In fact, I once had a situation where I bought a ticket on Kenya Airways website, and then discovered additional charges on my credit card saying, ""Kenya Airways."" It turned out that a scam artist was stealing information from Kenya Airways and actually using the name, ""Kenya Airways."" Obviously, this is a real problem!
4. If you have a problem and need to make a change or seek a refund, don't waste much time on the matter. If they offer you a refund with a 40% cancellation fee, take it immediately (even if it makes no sense and isn't fair)! Take whatever you can get but be prepared to get nothing. Sorry, but this is just the way it is.

"In my own view, this is one of the worst airlines if not the WORST to travel with. If you have other options for your travel please take it.

Here is my story.. My scheduled travel was interrupted about six weeks in advance when the airline made changes to my flight. And according to Delta airlines, Kenya Airways did not ""release the ticket"". When I went to the airport I was shocked to learn that I di not have a connecting Delta flight because the airline ""owned my ticket"". I was forced to travel to a different airport and connect to the correct airport, JFK, via taxi ( at my own cost). When I got to JFK I was even more shocked because Kenya Airways could not ""check me in their system"". Instead of being checked in within five minutes, I spent close to FOUR hours waiting.

"Check In was a lengthy process as a result of having a few check in counters available.
Could not check in online as their systems were down. This happens quite frequently.
During this covid period ensure you book your seat when making your booking as the seat number is required prior to departure when filling in the Health Questionnaire's that most airlines require prior to departure.
Boarding remains a very chaotic process as they do not board by zones and from the back of the aircraft.
This aircraft type was a Boeing 787.
Excellent leg room for economy class but the seat remains fairly narrow and uncomfortable because the cushioning is very basic.
In flight entertainment selection is poor, nothing that is the latest, small selection of the various genres, small screen therefore I would recommend to bring your own downloaded movies. The headphones are probably the worst I have had on an airline in that it does not keep out any ambient noise and they are in ear earphones.
In flight service was 1 main meal. They serve the meal in take away boxes and encourage you to take the meal with you. Unfortunately this restricts the composition of the meal. Small salad starter, a roll and a small portion main course of either fish, chicken or vegetarian pasta. All the food was completely tasteless with no flavour and very dry. This applied to any of the selections. I would recommend to eat at the airport if you want to have a proper meal and not get to your destination hungry.
Flight time was just over 3 hours.
Drinks was only served with the meal and no water was served throughout the cabin during the flight. If you wanted drinks outside of the meal time, you had to specifically request it.
Cabin crew was friendly.
Toilets were not kept clean throughout the flight.
When the plane landed they parked quite far away from the main terminal and close to an antigen testing passenger facility which had to be accessed by staircase.
Overall experience was average and this would not be an airline of choice when travelling.
Plan to spend 2 hours upon disembarkation from South Africa as a result of the rigorous heath check and antigen testing process on the ground.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JPadman,JPadman wrote a review Dec 2021,JPadman,"Johannesburg, South Africa",33 contributions,61 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Nairobi,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r822331714-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Better Experience Than Most African Airlines,Date of travel: December 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Kenya and Kenyans are so wonderful at hospitality - warm, attentive and the quality of fresh food available across the country is wonderful.

So why is Kenya Airways Simba Lounge at Nairobi airport so dismal?

I travel through this airport often and am consistently disappointed. Buffet breakfast offerings are weird (baked beans, rubbery chunks of cheap frankfurters and pieces of cold spinach omelette). Last time, buffet was closed, the staff said it was table service only. I asked for a plate of fruit, 2 fried eggs and bacon and “anything else hot”. I told the waiter that I only had 20 minutes before boarding call. There were only 5 people in the lounge, including me. After 15 minutes and some nagging, I got a plate of baked beans and a piece of cold omelette! No fruit. That came later (after more nagging). There was no hot water for a cup of tea (had to nag). Eggs never arrived. She was sweet - not her fault that everything was substandard - but she was obviously getting pressure from the other 4 travelers for better service too and could barely keep up. This is not of international standards and much below expectations for business class travellers.

Come on Kenya Airways - you can do better than this at relatively small cost.

Tempted to switch to BA (who have unapologetically downgraded me twice so hard to forgive) but I’ve always been loyal to KQ and enjoy their warm, humorous on-board service.

"Kenya Airways is part of the problem. My ticket from Cape Town 28/11 to Nairobi/Mombasa was cancelled because I didn’t fill requirements of fully vaccinated. Nothing of this had been communicated on Kenya Airways or Kenya- or Swedish embassy web pages. So 1/2 of Eur 600 I paid for the round trip ticket should be refunded. But this criminal company called Travelgenio decided to pocket that money instead of refunding me! This was their answer: “Thank you for contacting us. In reply to your request we inform you that partial refund is not allowed. Thank you for contacting us”.

I’ve had a nuisance passenger next to me a couple of times and they refused to change my seat even though they had spares available - and I agree that they did tell the passenger to behave but it would have helped if they just let me move as it only made the flight more awkward. Food was so spicy it upset my stomach.

Whilst checking in the staff was rude and discriminatory just because I told her I’m not yet vaccinated. I have health problems and have held off getting vaccinated temporarily but frankly it’s no one’s business and they don’t have a right to be ratty with people who are not jabbed.

"Be very very wary of booking a flight with Kenya Airways.  I booked with them through Expedia.  I was 'provisionally' charged the full amount for two tickets (an Expedia representative say this is Kenya Airways normal way to check you have enough funds to pay for the flight).  Then three days later I was automatically charged again for each of the two tickets!  BUT the provisional charge of nearly £1,000 was never reversed.  This 'provisional' charge means you cannot access your £1,000.  It effectively comes out of your account for 31 days.  I spoke to the bank who issued the card I used.  They were helpless to do anything for 31 days unless Kenya Airways issued a reversal of the 'provisional payment'.

Via an alternative number I managed to get connected with a person, but 3 times the connection got broken or the employee hung up.

"Given the many not-so-great reviews about Kenya Airways, I went into this flight with relatively low expectations. However, I found almost none of the negative reviews to be true.

First off the check in process online and in person was easier than my experience with even some US airlines. I was able to check in online and then at the check in counter at JFK (where there was absolutely no line) the attendant was able to ""upgrade"" my wife and I to an exit row for no additional charge (whereas on the website this was an additional fee. My one complaint about the seat selection process is that It's pretty unclear what paying more for a seat really gets you. Either way, i'd recommend doing it at the counter. Also - I used their whatsapp number to try and attempt to upgrade to business class and was communicating with a real person!

The flight itself was fairly empty, perhaps 60% to capacity. Overall I thought the plane was very spacious, clean and the service was excellent. They were cleaning the bathrooms frequently and refilling drinks without even asking. Overall the food was fine... nothing to go crazy about, but it was pretty much what you'd expect with economy airline food (chicken or pasta).

I will say, as many of the other reviews have noted, the entertainment system was pretty sub par. They had a few great movies, and not the most intuitive UI. I did also find it bizarre there wasn't even an option for wifi.. it's slightly old school, just download stuff in advance! The seat itself also didn't have the best lumbar support, I used the pillow they gave you for added support and brought a head pillow.

Our final destination was JRO with a 3 hour layover in Nairobi. Overall our journey was about 16 ish hours, FAR LESS than some of the other options with Qatar, KLM etc. which are all great airlines, but I do value time (and saving money), so I thought this was a great overall option for someone going on Safari in Kenya and/or Tanzania. I'd do it again for sure.

Not a knock on Kenya Airways, but the NBO airport is pretty poor, i'd recommend going to the lounge if your credit card or status gives you lounge access. We paid $40 a piece to sit in there for 2.5 hours which was fine, but not one of the better lounges I have seen.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/88/03/d2/james-a.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheMrJames,TheMrJames wrote a review Oct 2021,TheMrJames,"New York City, New York",12 contributions,13 helpful votes,New York City - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r814605873-Kenya_Airways-World.html,JFK > NBO Dreamliner,Date of travel: September 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Man, shout out to the rockstar at Kenyan  Airways in Joburg by the name of Lydia. I had an issue with my Covid test (did it too  early so it would have expired by the time I got to Ghana). The whole situation was such a mess, I was certain that I would not be able to fly. Lydia advised me that there was a quick testing station outside (which obviously required me to pay an arm and a leg because these Covid test fees are a scam. I digress). She waited for me until the last minute to get my results so she could get my bag checked-in. When I was running between the testing station and the check-in counter, she decided that I could leave my bag there (I was literally the only remaining customer, so she was just being kind) and took my number so I could run downstairs to go check on my results and she could call me once it was absolutely necessary for them to close the counter. She did call me, and while I was running a few minutes late, she spoke to her superiors who agreed that the time was negligible and I could therefore run back upstairs with my results while she waited to quickly send my bag through. Lydia was probably the most helpful and noncynical airport person I'd ever met. While some of her colleagues were annoyed with my situation and essentially had given up on me, she endeavoured to help me well beyond her call of duty. This is the kind of South Africa I know - one filled with ubuntu, while acting within the confines of professional conduct. Lydia didn't break any rules or try to cut be some slack because that would have been unethical and against her professional conduct. Instead, she humanized herself and just literally did what most of us would do for each other on the daily. She didn't become clinical or inhumane simply because she was at work - she was both kind and professional. We need more Lydia's at the airport!!!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/fe/default-avatar-2020-58.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandisiweeletuy,Sandisiwe Eletu Y wrote a review Sep 2021,Sandisiwe Eletu Y,,2 contributions,2 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Accra,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r810846488-Kenya_Airways-World.html,The service desk support worker for Kenyan Airways in Joburg by the name of Lydia is a rockstar!!!,Date of travel: September 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Let me preface this review by stating that I am not an overly critical reviewer, feel free to check my other reviews. With that out of the way let's begin.       If you live in the USA, you are probably planning your once in a lifetime safari vacation via Kenya Airways direct flight from JFK to Nairobi, and you have noticed the cheap price. You're probably thinking ""how bad can it be?"". Let me tell you.      Our adventure started two years ago as we planned our trip to Uganda and Kenya.  We were to fly to Nairobi from JFK, then transfer to Entebee. After our Uganda safari we would fly back to Nairobi and do a short Kenya safari before flying home. Like most travellers, COVID ruined our 2020 plans. Kenya Airways offered vouchers, again like most airlines. Now the fun began. There website does not show a US phone number, but I found one and used it, but most of the time they either didn't pick up or you were put on hold until you had to give up and get on with your life. The website did have a online chat with a type to an agent option. The chat would start with KA writing you are in third position approximate wait 15 minutes, after an hour you would be in first position and get a message ""all our agents are busy please try later. At times I even emailed guest services, after a few days I sometimes got a response. At one point I gave in and phoned the Nairobi office, there I got a response and $30 phone bill. Eventually I got everything in place, including what the call premium economy. Premium economy cost  a $150 dollars a seat extra and got you the front row of economy with no one in the middle seat of there 3-3-3 set up. On the flight to Nairobi I asked if they had any available business class left, they did and at a reasonable price I upgraded. Nobody can screw up business class, so we had a nice flight to Nairobi. My only complaint, and slight is that the entertainment package was pretty bad. Their showcase movies was stuff I saw  six months or a year ago on HBO.        Now for the flight home. We arrived at the airport 3.5 hours early, after all things get slow because of COVID precautions. KA booked their flights to New York and Paris fifteen minutes apart. As a result you had around 700 people checking in at four check-in desks. Not exactly a safe way to check people in at this time. When we got to the check-in desk, I asked if they had anything available in business and was told it was a completely sold out.  My wife and I at least were comforted with the fact we would get the front row of economy with the middle seat empty.. When we got on the plane, we approached our seats and guess what: the middle seats had people in them.  We took our narrow hard seats, that were better than Frontier airlines seats, but nowhere as good as a Southwest Airlines seat. From there we started our 14 hour flight home, where we were served horrible food (even by airlines standards), with the old fashioned two prong earphones in which you ad to install the pads on the earphones by yourself. The little amenities you usually find on long haul flights like a small personal care kit were available only in business class. The only fortunate part of the flight is that it took off at midnight, so we somehow slept through half the torture.       So let me sum up. You are probably looking forward to a trip of a lifetime, and it's one pretty penny. Pay a little extra and find another airline. If your safari doesn't start in Kenya, you are going to transfer anyway so don't be lured by the direct flight. If you don't heed my advice and have the same type of trip that I and other reviewers speak of, you can't say you weren't warned.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bschoenb,bschoenb wrote a review Aug 2021,bschoenb,"Smithtown, New York",180 contributions,80 helpful votes,New York City - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r805648354-Kenya_Airways-World.html,WARNING DON'T FLY,Date of travel: August 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I had my relative travel from addiss ababa to nairobi to catch a flight to dubai. her flight from addiss ababa to nairobi was ethiopian airlines and then her flight from nairobi to dubai was on kenya airlines. once arrived in nairobi the airport staff asked for a return ticket to addis ababa. my relative had 2 return tickets one was on august 15 on ethiopion earlines and another was emirates airlines on august 31 direct from dubai to addiss ababa. the airport staff refused to let her board and demanded she book a ticket using kenya airways for a return flight from dubai - nairobi - addis ababa. they also promised to use the same ticket for nairobi to dubai with no extra charge given a return ticket was purchased from kenya airways. this is absolute corruption, 2 tickets of 2 different airlines were provided and yet they needed to book on kenya airways. all this is because she refused to pay a bribe to kenya airways staff because she did not carry money with her.

He asked me to leave and apply for it, I may miss my flight. (KQ304). While informing that I live in Dubai for almost 10 years, holding an Investor Visa and being sponsor for others, he asked me about my nationality and told me that ""he will let me go on board"" not because I have employment at the Ministry of Interior, as an Investor, but because he ""let's me"" .

"We flew Kenya Airways for the 1st time on this trip to the Serengeti on 11-20 June 2021. In total we had 7 flights. The aircraft were generally smaller & seen rather outdated especially the proper plane from Nairobi to Dar es Salaam . The onboard entertainment from movies to music is totally outdated & very limited. Headrests of seats are not adjustable. The intercom systems on most flights were very soft & we could hardly here what the pilots were saying , they also never communicated locations we were flying over & there is no flight monitoring option , its nice to be informed of locations as we flew over a huge lake but did not know where it was or which lake it was. Even flying over Zambezi/Vic Falls not a word was said , fortunately we had been here before so we could identify it.

The Nairobi airport also needs a bit of an upgrade , some facilities are really run down & they created mass confusion when display boards at the airport & boarding passes differed in terms of boarding gate , people were running all over. The signage is also not very clear in terms of gates .

Food was also not that great , one flight we only got a dry roll.

On the up side flights generally departed & arrived on time.

Not a great overall experience & we will only use Kenya Airways if we had no other choice",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/5a/default-avatar-2020-36.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/269andreh,Andre H wrote a review Jun 2021,Andre H,"Cape Town, South Africa",367 contributions,171 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Dar es Salaam,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r793484202-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Need an upgrade,Date of travel: June 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

This is really bad conduct and inconsiderate. We had to book another flight which will only leave next day. Had to book hotel for the night and retake travel tests. Incurred a lot of costs. To top it off, still got no notification and there's no customer service support. This is so appalling, I don't know why you're allowed to still operate.

"They do not care, they will NOT try. They will cancel flights at the last minute without ever even notifying the passengers who are planning to go back to home in Africa.. Their website CLEARLY says they will decide to cancel their own flights which alone speaks to the magnitude of a airline of themselves and it says they will provide notifications and they've cancelled my flight three times and they've NEVER notifying me. They told me they would put me on June 8th instead I said ok suddenly they're cancelling it until the 9th and I can't know that checking online even though I had to sleep inside of the airport.

I was taken to the police station to be documented because I'm just walking around in this country and I've told them everything they do not care they won't even give me a food Vouchers after cancelling three flights and now without even eating they expect that I will be able to do another covid test by myself when I don't even have money to contact me family with my cell phone.

"I missed my flight to Dubai on the 3rd of May because I got my entry permit late.
I wen to the Kenya airways office in Douala for assistance.
I was given 2 options, a flight on Wednesday and Sunday. I couldn't take Wednesday because I had to go again for a Covid test, so I told the lady to reschedule my flight on Sunday which she accepted and told me the amount I will pay to get my flight for Sunday, I paid, little did I know the details on the Sunday flight and as bad as the service was she didn't inform me that I was going to stay for 24hr in Nairobi before my next flight.

she asked for my email address so she will send my ticket which I gave. then my ticket was sent.
I call back to complain about the flight duration and someone told me not to worry I will be take care of, I trusted them but, they betrayedmy trust.

just for me to get to Nairobi and was helpless sleeping in the airport for 24hrs & no one cared. I went to the office in Nairobi and met this very rude lady. I asked for help even drinking water, which I couldn't get. this lady who at the end of every discussion told me I was the one who chose to flight with Kenya airways, that made to understand my choice was a bad choice. I wasn't alone we were in numbers.

I went for 24hrs without food no water simply because of bad service, redness, etc.
I think the need to retrain their staff, orientated them on how to guide thier guests and how to be hospitable. I would have made myself ready to feed myself if I was well orientated about my flight.

"Twice now, within the past 6 months, I have tried to book a flight on Kenya air, only to have that flight cancelled on me. This most recent time, of which I am currently on hold with the airline for hour 3, leaves me with absolutely no other flight to go to my destination. Nothing. And as I have tried to rebook both on the webchat (another three hours to have the genius-level employee say the flight is indeed cancelled) and rebook through my very, very ... very long phone call with them, the service is so poor, so unimaginably poor that I have to wonder, is this even a real airline? Come to think of it, I have not seen a Kenyan air flight myself. I've seen pictures of an airplane marked Kenya air, but...that could be photoshopped in like ten minutes.

"I have heard a lot about Kenya Airways : the bad service, the luggage that gets lost, the bad customer service, the rude agents ... But I decided to give a go and never I would have imagined experiencing such an awful experience.

I was traveling with a pet and one of Kenya airway's agent was suppose to assist me in doing so. Not only did he not give me the correct information, not follow up on my case, but he was also very rude when confronted. I arrived at the airport and I had to pay way more than expected because he didn't care to explain correctly the procedure. One I got to Nairobi because I had to transit there before Johannesburg I was informed that my pet was booked for the next day flight and he had not even informed me. Now the custom service in Johannesburg is helding the pet for quarantine because we did not arrive at the same time and I have to pay the extra cost FOR FOURTEEN DAYS. And when I confronted him about this situation his answer was that it is the customer's duty to ask for information ! No apology no solution no help whatsoever

Never will I ever use this airline again even if I have to pay more or take a longer flight I prefer investing in a airline that treats their customer correctly : shameful !",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Global706620,Ndandu wrote a review Apr 2021,Ndandu,,18 contributions,6 helpful votes,Kinshasa - Johannesburg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r786829482-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Worst experience ever,Date of travel: April 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have been hearing a lot about Kenya airways : about the bad service, the luggage being lost, the wrong information being given, the bad customer service but I had never imagined that it would have been to that extent.

I was traveling with a pet to South Africa : the person in Kenya Airways from Kinshasa in charge was suppose to assist me in doing so. Not only did he not inform me of all the procedures, the prices and didn't follow up on the situation but he was very rude when I confronted him telling me it is the duty of the customer to ask. I found myself paying way more than expected at the airport and having to make a transit at Nairobi before Johannesburg he didn't even follow up on the transit of the pet which was supposed to be on the same day. I had to come back to the airport the next day and my pet was held in quarantine because they didn't insure the transit in Nairobi on the same day and I wasn't even informed. Now I have to pay for all this and when I called his answer was that there is nothing he could do not even an apology or a solution.

THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. I am never ever going to use this airline again even if the cost is cheaper or the flight is shorter I prefer spending more money on another airline that respect their customer",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Global706620,Ndandu wrote a review Apr 2021,Ndandu,,18 contributions,6 helpful votes,Kinshasa - Johannesburg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r786829169-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Worst experience ever !,Date of travel: April 2021,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The worst airline experience I have ever had which is a great shame as many other African carriers have become excellent in recent years. The Business class is the worst I have been in - incredibly uncomfortable seats, very low quality food and the most limited entertainment system I have ever seen. And of course no WiFi. Onboard service is mediocre at best. They also managed to lose my bag which led me to the worst customer service I have ever met - well not entirely fair as I haven't met them as they don't answer the phone or emails and their online chat system is a scam. I assume this is their way of not accepting responsibility for losing luggage and avoiding their mandated requirement to assist and provide some form of compensation.

"Since I reviewed this airline in 2017, I have flown with them once (2018) and I've had to deal with them for a booking I made for 2020 (COVID rescheduling). To say their service is bad is an understatement. Their service is non-existent here in South Africa. They seem to have a single employee who is constantly confused and seems to be angry all the time. Unfortunately if you are trying to use your vouchers from last year you HAVE to book through her via telephone because she does not seem to understand how to work a computer. After booking and paying the extra fees and spending a fortune calling the single South African employee, I received a random email the other day with my itinerary and one of my connecting flights is missing!

"Due to covid l could not travel in 2020 so they gave me a voucher and they told me l would not need to top up anything . So l have been trying to book for over a month with no help at all. Their Dubai office never picks up the phone just forever continuously ringing . Decided to go the their office only to be told come back 3 days prior your departure date . Went back 3 days prior my departure date and l was told they are unable to book my voucher as it was converted to EURO from the Kenya , if it was not in AED they wouldn’t book so l have to call Kenya so they can convert it to AED . They could have told me this the first time l went there but because they did not even bother to look at my voucher they just said come back later . Had they looked at the voucher at that time then they would have save me a trip and my time .There was no customer service effort to say lemme me call our customer service in Kenya to change for you but no they said go home and cal Kenya. Trying to call Kenya was mission as they did not pick up either . After weeks l tried their email which was a dead end aswell with response after days and with my last email ignored until now .With my voucher about to expire it’s like they are stalling so that it just expires. When l finally got hold of Kenya l was told l needed to do a top up on a ticket that l was told l would not need to do a top and the amount said was enough enough to just buy a new ticket . They are not even bothered at all and their customer service is the worst  . I have just been forced to donate money to Kenyan airways as no one has helped for almost a month and my voucher is about to expire. This is like a forced donation to Kenyan airline .

Flew Kenya airways 5 years ago and thought the service was bad. Without another option due to covit booked for a flight 30th march to Heathrow KQ100. To say ther service was terrible is an understatement. The cabin crew ( the ones at the back) where rude and unconcerned. No drinks or food where served for over 5hrs apart from half glasses of water 5 at a time knowing it was a full flight with children. Passengers had to walk up and down to ask for drinks contrary to the captain's advice to minimize movement due to the pandemic.  Asked the madam in glasses for a drink she kindly passed me on to her mate as she was on her phone the friend was not in a rush either as she was having her lunch before the passengers 4 hrs in.

"Kenya Airways - Extremely Unsatisfied Customers, Have We Been Robbed?
I/We are extremely unsatisfied with the customer service and support from this airline. We have been trying to rebook our flights to Kenya for the last 6 months with only one response which was on Christmas Eve of 2020 and we haven't heard anything from them ever since. We have a booked and paid for trip which we had to rebook due to covid-19 in 2020. Our trip is expected to be this April(2021), and we had supposedly received our cancelled flights in the form of a refunded 'voucher' which was never ever received from the airline. We then received (on Christmas Eve) a link to our supposedly 'new flights' which had a time frame to a payment portal from 15h00-17h30/18h00 roughly... let me reiterate, on Christmas Eve, who is checking their emails to rebook flights in such a short time frame?
We then tried to access the portal that night at 19h00 and we could not access it to pay an additional fee (when this was supposed to be fully refunded I might add) for our flights in April.
I have sent roughly 50 emails to the airline, and that doesn't include my partners emails to #KenyaAirways. We have heard nothing back from them, and they have about R35 000 of our money in promised refunded tickets which we do not have and cannot get hold of anybody from Kenya Airways. This is beyond unprofessional and I have literally tried to contact any/everyone I possibly could from Kenya Airway. I really hope we have not been robbed by Kenya Airways #KenyaAirways and we can either book our flights as promised, before our holiday would be great, or get our money back!

I have a blue padlock and a key marked with the same colour. I reported that the padlock on this bag was not mine.The fake padlock replaced could be opened with any key. Inside my suitcase,all the items were haphazardly arranged and it was clear someone opened the suitcase. This claims were met with defense from a security person from the airline saying it is impossible for that to happen. I had personal belongings in this suitcase with no money or electronics which were in my boarding luggage. I was so disturbed that something like this is possible plus given the Covid situation,I am not sure why someone from the airline would open a suitcase and handle/search my belongings without permission then attach a wrong padlock there.

"Flights from Kilimanjaro to Dubai via Nairobi (Kenya Airways)

The main question is why Kenya Airways is selling tickets to customers for flights that they are no longer operating? This is misleading and deceitful!

Initial flights booked online with Kenya Airways on 18/10/2020 by credit card

Flights Details:
Kilimanjaro to Nairobi Flight KQ427 19th December
Nairobi to Dubai Flight KQ304 19th December
Dubai to Nairobi Flight KQ305 4th January
Nairobi to Kilimanjaro Flight KQ0426 4th January

On the 7/12/2020, I filled in an online support to seek confirmation that the flights would go ahead and I received an automated response to confirm that the flights would still go ahead, which was untruthful on the part of Kenya Airways.

On the 15th December, we received an email from Kenya Airways Arusha Office to inform us that Flight KQ427 from Kilimanjaro to Nairobi on 19th December had been cancelled and that we were going to be redirected via Dar Es Salam and had to take Flight PW0431 with Precision Air from Kilimanjaro to Dar Es Salam. She sent us new tickets by email but for some reason, issued new tickets with different Booking Reference Numbers.

Flight details:
Kilimanjaro to Dar Es Salam Flight PW0431 19th December
Dar Es Salam to Nairobi Flight KQ0485 19th December
Nairobi to Dubai Flight KQ304 19th December

Dubai to Nairobi Flight KQ305 4th January
Nairobi to Kilimanjaro Flight KQ0426 4th January

On the 18th December, one day before our journey, we received an automated email to inform us that Flight KQ 304 from Nairobi to Dubai on the 19th December had been cancelled and that we were rebooked onto Flight KQ 304DE on 20th December at 6:05 instead but we received no updated tickets. We were then sent an automated email message that my wife was now booked onto an Emirates flight EK 722 that evening but no information about my son or me. I attempted to seek help on the online via the Kenya Airways site but nobody replied to us to check if we had all been booked on to the Emirates flight but nobody replied. New tickets were not emailed to us either, so we were left confused as to which flights we were now supposed to take from Nairobi to Dubai.

Our Experience on the 19th December 2020 - Outward Journey:

At Check-in for Precision Air Flight, we were informed by the check-in member of staff that my wife's flight ticket had been exchanged but that they had not received the new ticket from Kenya Airways on their system, so she could not fly. Precision Air staff manged to make contact with Kenya Airways and it was eventually sorted.

In Dar Es Salam, we managed to speak to a member of staff at the Kenya Airways sales office at Terminal 3 to try to confirm our flights from Nairobi to Dubai and that we were all still booked on the same flight as a family. She was very unhelpful and said that she could not help us, despite the fact we were now booked on different flights. She said that we had to proceed on the next leg of our journey to Nairobi and seek help at the transfer desk in Nairobi.

On arrival in Nairobi, we proceeded to the transfer desk and the member of staff was helpful. She removed my wife from the Emirates flight and rebooked my wife back to the morning flight, so that we could travel together as a family. The member of staff was very helpful, organised us a transit visa and a hotel room for a few hours before the morning flight to Dubai. We simply do not understand why my wife's flight was changed and not my son and mine without even asking us, informing us properly or even sending us any updated tickets?
The morning flight from Nairobi to Dubai was a very pleasant flight!

On the 25th December, we finally received a Guest Support Response from Faith Mutuku from Kenya Airways regarding our outward journey but by that time, we had arrived in Dubai.

On the 1st January 2021, I received an email with a new Electronic ticket for the Return Flights but no new tickets were sent for my wife or my son. I replied to the email to request new updated tickets were emailed but we received no reply and no new tickets for them

Our Experience on the 4th December 2020 - Return Journey.

We proceeded to Dubai airport for our flights from Dubai to Nairobi and Nairobi to Dar Es Salam and there were no problems despite the fact we had no new tickets for my wife or son. Both were pleasant flights.

We were informed at Check-in at Dubai airport that our bags would be checked in all the way to Kilimanjaro airport. This was NOT the case. On arrival at Dar Es Salam, our bags were left unattended by the conveyer belt, so we collected them. It is fortunate that we spotted them!

On check-in for our Precision Air Flight PW0438 from Dar Es Salam to Kilimanjaro, we were informed that they had no updated ticket on their system for my wife and son. They attempted to contact Kenya Airways by phone but nobody replied. I went to seek help from the Kenya Airways desk in Terminal 3 but it was closed. I asked the Service desk in Terminal 3 to help. She managed to get a male Kenya Airways staff member on the phone and I spoke to him. He did not want to help and provided me with another number to call (+255 786390002). We tried to call the new number many times and nobody answered. We also tried to call the Arusha Office number but nobody answered. Kenya Airways was uncontactable and there was nobody to offer help! Kenya Airways had left my wife Stephanie and son Alex stranded in Dar Es Salam with no way to get to Kilimanjaro Airport. This is unacceptable!

We were left in a desperate situation, so we went back to Precision Air to see if they could help us. They said that in order to fly, we would need to purchase new tickets for my wife and son and claim a refund for the flights from Kenya Airways. We had no choice but to purchase new tickets so they could fly from Dar Es Salam to Kilimanjaro despite the fact we had already bought and paid for tickets with Kenya Airways! This is absolutely disgraceful on the part of Kenya Airways!

We purchased two tickets for my wife and son at a cost of TZS 319,780 each person, a total of TZS 639, 560, which we want refunded immediately.

Our initial flights which we booked were from Kilimanjaro to Dubai via Nairobi and Kenya Airways had a responsibility and duty of care to make sure we got to our destination. They did not honour the tickets or flights that we had booked.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1c/d7/13/00/visitcamborne.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SmejkalIJ,Ian wrote a review Jan 2021,Ian,"Moshi, Tanzania",46 contributions,22 helpful votes,Kilimanjaro National Park - Dubai,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r780584726-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Flight cancellations & constant changes and left stranded!!,Date of travel: December 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"During Covid problems happen. We all know that, but if we all stopped traveling then companies like Kenya Airways would not be able to make any money at all. So when they mess up and misinform their customers, they should take responsibility for their mistakes. Instead, I have phone their customer helpline three times and rather than elevate my complaint to a manager so that they can deal with it, they have hung up on me three times (so far). I have also left my number with their manager (John) so that he can call me back to deal with my complaint. I was told he'd phone in ten minutes. It's now nearly two hours and he still hasn't called. This is a company that hangs up on you.  I am stuck in Zanzibar with my family, and this is how they are dealing with me. My youngest son was in tears when he heard we couldn't go home.

They keep blaming KLM but the ticket was theirs. Still no refund. Would never recommend them to anyone. The last flight we took from them in November 2019 was spontaneously cancelled the night before. Leaving us with only the choice of a flight that meant sitting in Nairobi airport for 8 hours because no consideration was taken about our connecting flight.

"This is the worst airline service to take . First flights are usually delayed by 3 hours so you will miss your connecting flight and they won’t put you on the earliest one the next day but the same time your were supposed to connect when you missed it for example my connect flight was at 11.45 pm I missed it due to their delay and they put me on a flight at 11.45 pm the next day and not the earliest flight .Then their systems go down and they have to manually check you in, your bags will be left behind despite them promising you they have left with you on the same flight and you have to wait for them to arrive this might take four days. I highly do not recommend this airline. If you do insist on using it pack your essential items in hand luggage and fly with them .And carry hard plastic bags , bags normally come out cracked due to manhandling them by the staff",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/fe/default-avatar-2020-58.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marshmallowcookie,Vanessa D wrote a review Dec 2020,Vanessa D,"Stellenbosch, South Africa",2 contributions,1 helpful vote,Cape Town Central - Dar es Salaam,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r779751303-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Inconvenient and Unprofessional,Date of travel: December 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Kenya airways is the worst airline in the whole wide world.
My ticket was cancelled just the day before my flight at Dubai International Airport because I'm not a South African passport holder!!
The agent told me that I was receive my full refund because i showed up at the airport. I was stuck at the airport the whole night had to look for funds to buy a ticket to my country directly.....
The staff was so unfriendly.
It's been 2 and a half months since my refund has not yet been processed and received and all they do is send me emails of empty promises.
Please DONT use Kenya airways otherwise you will be disappointed with their terrible service.

"I traveled from London to Nairobi and the outbound flight was fine. Upon check in on my return flight, I realised that my booking reference number would not work and phoned them and they said that the flight was cancelled as there were not enough passengers and not commercially viable for them to fly me back. A date was proposed for two days later which I had no option but to accept and was advised to email my complaint to customer service which I did straightaway.
A month down the line and after a dozen phone calls, nothing has happened and spoke to a manger two weeks ago called Edith at the Nairobi contact centre who promised to contact me in 24 hours and we are now on day 14 from that conversation.

This airline just doesn’t care and once they’ve banked the money it’s completely out of your hands. I was set back a cool £350 as had to get accommodation for the extra two nights and pay an additional taxi fare for my transport that had been pre booked at Heathrow.

USE THEM AT YOUR OWN RISK.

If anything goes wrong or there’s a slight change, I advise you have additional funds as this is not the type of airline to care about your well-being despite being in a foreign land.

To imagine the penalties they impose on passages when you have to extend your stay but when they do it, they completely brush it under the carpet and would jot even have the courtesy to put some effort to resolve or compensate for your troubles.

Utterly disgusted.

Strongly advise using a European registered airline and watch out for a Kenya Airways affiliate as I worry they share the same culture.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/fe/default-avatar-2020-58.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/191hermank,Herman K wrote a review Dec 2020,Herman K,"London, United Kingdom",3 contributions,16 helpful votes,London - Nairobi,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r778950945-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Do not use them,Date of travel: November 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We are normally very happy with Kenya Airways services and flights; however, our last trip was possibly the worst experience we have had with any airline so far. Due to the Covid situation, we were stranded in India. We were told that our tickets will remain open until February 2021. Once Kenya opened up for tourism, we were able to get a tourist visa. We contacted the India office to assist us with information so we can make the booking without any errors. We were put in touch with Panatta, Seigfred, and Nirmala.

We were not allowed to use our open tickets because it was apparently a repatriation flight. However, the flight was full of Indian citizens traveling for holiday purposes, some not even holding a visa, yet Panatta was very rude to us and insisted that we must buy fresh tickets (at double the cost of a return ticket), have all our documentation, including a flight back to my home country, even though the regulation is return or onward flight.

The emails between ourselves and Panatta show that she was not bothered with trying to help but rather actively trying to make it difficult for us to travel. Even after talking to KQ Nairobi and being informed to be ok to take an onward flight to Cairo, Panatta refused and said that we have to buy a flight back to my home country. A 2000 dollars flight. To ensure that it is difficult for us to book this flight, Panatta asked for the return flight to be sent well in advance and to prove that this was not just a reservation but a paid booking. In these uncertain times, how are we supposed to pay for a flight despite not being sure if we will be able to take it?

If the Kenya side is open for tourism and has given us a visa, and accepted an onward flight, what concern would it be of Panatta's to force us to take a flight we did not want to book?

On arrival at the Mumbai Airport, the KQ check in desk also denied us boarding on the basis that my flight is booked 90 days from the time of visa application. The visa application clearly states that the application is valid for 3 months and stay in Kenya is valid for 3 months from date of arrival and not date of application. The Kenya Airways staff in India are not polite or professional. Panatta regards herself as the highest authority for KQ in India.

It is hard to believe that the objective of the staff for the people at the KQ India office is solely to make non Indian's lives harder by being rude and ignorant. We have heard from many other Kenyans, who have had similarly bad experiences with Panatta and her gang. It hurts me to say KQ is no longer the pride of Africa.

Finally, the flight back was a nightmare, the plane was dirty, the seats somehow got smaller, you cannot regulate the AC and the whole flight felt like a sauna. No social distancing or health protocols were followed at any time. They give you a kit and hope for the best. Will not recommend at all.

"Long story short
Kenya Airways sold me 2 tickets from their official website for 2 different people to same destination of already canceled flights “the flights were canceled since weeks before I bought them”
I found that out by chance when I called just to check on rules in Nairobi airport transit, the lady of customer service told me it was canceled since weeks, when I asked her how it was canceled when I have just bought them 5 days a go she shut the phone-call on my face, and no email replies.
When I complained at their office they pushed me to keep the ticket for later “which I am not going again” or take a voucher for 1 year only, instead of refunding me.
Even though our 2 tickets were refundable tickets.
Having your flight canceled is understandable but to sell you an already canceled non-existing flight is totally extremely out of any expectation and a clear sign of disregard for clients or the company’s own reputation.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TahaKS,Taha Elbarghathi wrote a review Sep 2020,Taha Elbarghathi,,19 contributions,22 helpful votes,Cairo - Kilimanjaro National Park,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r770331953-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Selling tickets of canceled flight ,Date of travel: September 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Due to the Covid pandemic the cabin crew wear from start to finish hair caps, masks, gloves, and a full length gown.

This does not prevent them from being hospitable and welcoming.

"We booked flights from Dubai to Kilimanjaro, flying via Nairobi. Several days before departure, I just happened to Google Kenya Airways and discovered that Tanzania was not allowing Kenya Airways flights into the country. This decision had been made PRIOR to me booking the flight, so not only did Kenya Airways sell us flights to a destination they were barred from traveling to, but when I called to verify this, the person I spoke to was extremely dismissive. My biggest gripe was that we were due to fly in three days and NO ONE from Kenya Airways had contacted us to inform us of the flight cancellation.

"We were supposed to fly from Amsterdam to Nairobi on 8/26 on Kenya Airways returning on 9/7 on KLM.  In early June I saw that the outbound flight had been cancelled.  According to Consumer Reports, the EU has a law stating that, if a flight is taking off or landing in the EU and that flight is cancelled, the airline MUST issue a refund upon request.   I immediately asked my travel agent to request a refund. She told me that, despite the law, Kenya Airways was not issuing refunds – only vouchers.  We decided to wait a bit to see if they would issue refunds.On 6/29 I received an email from my travel agent informing me that Kenya Airways said we either had to take a voucher by 6/30 or lose getting a voucher good for 2 years from the booking date. Since we booked in November, this would give us 16 months to use it instead of a year. We felt we had no choice but to take the voucher even though it should have been 2 years from date of departure.Sometime between early June and 6/29 Kenya Airways reinstated the flight.  Despite this reinstatement we should have been given a refund when the flight was cancelled and we requested it.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/77/ae/default-avatar-2020-2.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/655bettyannem,Betty Anne wrote a review Jul 2020,Betty Anne,"Seattle, Washington",2 contributions,11 helpful votes,Amsterdam - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r758822476-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Flight cancelled: Refused refund,Date of travel: July 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We flew from JFK to NBO just before the pandemic was declared. This was the first leg of a journey to Seychelles (SEZ). We found the cabin crew on this flight to be excellent, attentive, and really friendly. I had read reports about the service and staff being patchy on this route with travelers left for hours without refreshments or with unfriendly staff but it seemed that the cabin staff were up and down the aisles very frequently and always had a smile on their faces .... something that must be tough during these times. We told them how pleased we were at the end of the flight and they seemed genuinely surprised to get the positive feedback. We passed this on to the airline via their website but have received no response as yet.

Check in at JFK was easy, but probably atypical due to the reduced number of flyers in early March this year. The same could be said for the boarding process.

The plane itself was new, a lovely 787 with mood lighting and big windows. The legroom was reasonable (not cramped but not luxurious). Overall it was comfortable for such a long journey. The food on the outbound journey was actually really good, way better than we expected, and our son' child's meal was also better than typical kids meals.

The biggest negative on our outbound journey was the entertainment system. There were very few recent movies and the choice was extremely limited. Take your tablet or phone and download some eBooks, movies or other entertainment to it. if you are expecting to use the system on the plane to keep you occupied for 14 hours you will be disappointed.

If I was rating the airline based on this flight I would actually give this flight 4 or even 5 stars as it was enjoyable but external factors are influencing that rating :

- Our return journey from Seychelles was delayed overnight by 14 hours and we had to fight to get accommodation. Due to this delay, and the Kenyan government ban on entry for foreigners due to COVID-19, it also meant our mini KQ Safari booked through the airline had to be cancelled. This is all very understandable and we have no issue with any of that. We cancelled this over email with the safari division while in the Seychelles and assumed there would be no issue.

However, despite meeting 3 of the criteria needed for refund I am now going through a VISA charge-back process to recover this fee. First they say to talk to travel agent (when we booked the safari directly through them on a different credit card number) and then they say its valid for a year and they do not refund services .. despite having a clear statement on their website that a refund can be done if you fit 1 of the 3 criteria - 1. contact the email provided within 24 hours of the safari to cancel (we did it 6 days before), 2. Have a flight cancellation or delay (we were cancelled and put on a flight 14 hours later), and 3. Being denied entry to the country (the government were denying foreign nationals even with a visa - which we had).

We want to go back to the Seychelles when all this is over but sadly I fear it will need to be with another airline, despite the stellar service of the staff on KQ003 on the day we flew.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/83/3c/37/highlanderict.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HighlanderICT,Scott M wrote a review May 2020,Scott M,Toronto,241 contributions,58 helpful votes,New York City - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r753560848-Kenya_Airways-World.html,"Cabin Staff were great .... the rest, average!",Date of travel: March 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My flight from Nairobi to Bangkok got canceled twice on March 17th with no prior notice. I only found out about it when asking the staff for the gate as the flight was still displayed“on schedule”. After 19 hours of waiting I was booked on an Emirates flight. Kenya Airways told me not to worry about the luggage transfer. At the time of boarding, sure enough the luggage had not been transferred in spite of the long hours of waiting. The Emirates staff said “Kenya Airways is always slow in responding” and asked me to contact them again to make sure my bags are transferred. The service desk is notoriously overcrowded and understaffed with extreme long waiting time, so I contacted their staff in the business lounge. They made some calls and assured my luggage had been transferred. Back to Emirates, they could not confirm that.

The staff were unfriendly, both at the airport and cabin crew. They had no interest in giving you relevant information unless asked several times. On the plane it's poor quality food and a Coke that came in a can covered in dirt and grime. The whole thing felt unhygienic.

"Travelled Kigali via Nairobi to Johannesburg and back within 2 days mid-March 2020. Aircrafts E190 on short leg and Boeing Dreamliners B788 on long legs. All flights on time. No luggage issues. Checked in online. Had to wait 1 hour in airport as they only open check in 2 hours before departure. Upgraded 1st leg KGL-NBO by a modest, but successful online bid. Granted lounge access by courtesy in Nairobi as my Gold Card was just earned during the same trip (but of course not processed in their system). In Kigali they use Pearl lounge which is deteriorating since Rwandair opened a new lounge opposite. Kenya Airways Pride Lounge in Nairobi is wonderful. Food served onboard was substandard and particular breakfasts were a disgrace. However, drink supplies were fine. I like the “Happy Hours” approach they use on regional routes like to Dubai and JNB where you order a drink or wine and they often double up the order without asking. I have only received this double up service before on Gulf Air and the now deceased Jet Airways. That is generous, positive approach and make one feel very appreciated and cared for in economy class where benefits otherwise are sparse. FAs are very good though advised an FA to avoid chewing gum as it is cause feeling of disrespect to some passengers. Champagne on business class is good and offered also before departure. No IFE on short legs but on long legs plenty of films to watch. No WiFi onboard.

The suspicious factor here though is that the only time I had precise timing frm them was a few years back on my various legs between Kenya and the Netherlands.

I haven't flown on a KQ flight which kept time all the way in 5 years! That is astonishing! These were all my regional flights in Africa.

"I flew on Kenya Airways to Nairobi and back to New York this past February.  Since it was part of a group booking I did not have much say in my seating and it was economy class.  However, despite the extremely long 14 hour flight I was fairly comfortable and given two meals and a snack on both flights.  The attendants are friendly and helpful and while any economy seat is not overly roomy these were certainly part than some other flights I have been on.   I would definitely use them again",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/23/89/b7/tasslegurl.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tasslegurl,Tasslegurl wrote a review Mar 2020,Tasslegurl,"Toronto, Canada",88 contributions,20 helpful votes,New York City - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r750454161-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Economy long haul flights to Kenya,Date of travel: February 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The flight experience was OK - flight left on time, plane was clean, food was limited but adequate and staff polite.  However the booking experience was very poor - all is handled by an overseas call centre, I had to phone several times and each time was kept on hold for an unacceptable period of time. Of most concern was that I was put on standby for the second part of my flight (Nairobi to London). I had paid full fare 2 months before departure and think a stand-by in mid journey (it is the airlines choice to route all through Nairobi)  was very poor practice and trying to resolve this issue  cost me much of the last day of my holiday.

"We decided to take non-stop flights from JFK to Nairobi in order to avoid suffering from rhe foibles of connecting flights.  We stayed overnight in Nairobi to catch our flight to Arusha the day after, a very good idea.  The trip over was just fine, typical care.  The cabin attendants were attentive, the food, surprisingly, acceptable.  The business class seats were flat sleeping beds, but not pods found on other airlines.  I found them perfectly fine, my wife felt the fabric was scratchy, while on other airlines the seats were leather.  We left and arrive virtually on time.  The Nairobi airport is a total BEAR.  I would question using it if we ever chose to return.  It is certainly not disability-friendly.  The return flight was quite an experience.  Thew flight was scehduled to leave at 11 PM, but since we had encountered lots of local traffic in Nairobi that day, we had our driver drop us off at the airport well in advance.  The airport again was a bear.  e went through one security checkpoint just to get to the check in point.  The business class checkin was very difficult to find.  Having cleared that obstacle, we then had to go through secutiry again at the gate, full inspection of carryons and metal detector scanning.  Once in we found that the temperature was too high, as if there was no air conditioning.  Travelling business class we were """"invited"" to the airlines ""Pride Club.""  Initially it felt cooler, there was a nice assortment of food and drink.  Then the electricity faild and the air conditioner never seemed to be effective after that.  After hours in there, we werr told to go to the gate.  My wife had purchased a bottle of water, and had to discr=ard it, since they would not allow it past securtiry, although we had already gone through 2 securities and the water had to be purchased in the terminal.At the gate we sat and waited, and waited.  We did see the crew standing at the gate, but they did not enter the aircraft until the actual estimated time of departure.  We finally enterred and were seated.  We heard some travellers say this flight is always late.  We left almost an hour late.The same situation with the seats as on the way to Nairobi.  Boarding and taking off at midnight, we had no desire for food.  When we awakened, we asked if there were any snacks, to which we were told no, there might be some sandwiches.  A reluctant cabin attendant found us a couple of plain rolls.We went back to sleep and about 2 hours before landing, they brough ""breakfast,"" a choice of rubber egg omelets with some unkown meat or a vegetarian dish with carrots and peas in a red curry sause and some aspict stuff.  We asked for some rolls, and that is what we got, multigrained rolls or white rolls, not normal breakfast type rolls.  I asked if they at least had some dry cereal and was told they never carry it.The flight was fine and we landed 45 minutes later than scheduled.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toxdoc42,toxdoc42 wrote a review Mar 2020,toxdoc42,"Hilton Head, South Carolina",13 contributions,11 helpful votes,New York City - Nairobi,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r750338978-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Non-Stop JFK to Nairobi,Date of travel: March 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Kenya airways is the the best choice in case one is looking to travel to Eastern, Southern & few West African countries from India. It has two flights from Mumbai. Economic and moderate services are offered on the flight. It has certainly made an impression on the Indians and hence, their passener count has grown since 2004 - my first ever flight to Africa, via Nairobi.

All though, Ethiopian, Rwand air, Emirates are giving tough competition to KQ, it has managed to maintain its class.

The service is fine. Nairobi has been busy lately, hence, keep enough time between the two connections. Unlike Bangkok Airways, they do not offer any lounge services to economy class passengers. And their business class loung does not have anything special. In fact, it remains crowded during early morning peak hours.

"Flight cancelled to Frankfurt, GE the day prior so Kenya Airways re-booked us for the next day. A group of us were placed in the rear of the plane. DO NOT make the mistake and get a seat in the last couple of rows. On a 15 hour flight we got the LAST of the dinner offer and were not given a choice. For breakfast the same thing happened. Only Poached egg or vegetarian was left when everyone else had full choices. On top of that, my screen sound did not work nor the subtitles. They re-set it twice and still did not work. The screen behind me did not work AT ALL! I had to sit for 15 hours watching as everyone else enjoyed their movies, music while I just sat. This is a poor airline. I am sure they re-sold my seat without repairs.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertmH4069DP,Robert C wrote a review Mar 2020,Robert C,,1 contribution,1 helpful vote,Nairobi - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r749130542-Kenya_Airways-World.html,"Under Stocked Food, In-Flight Movie Screen Problems",Date of travel: February 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Visiting Kenya was quite exciting and indeed interesting, the weather is beautiful.Went to the Nairobi museum, lovely old fashioned glass cupboards inside and very well maintained. A lot to see in one day, you need to spend several days to take it all in.  Went out to Sheldrick Wildlife Trust,the elephant orphanage  got to see and touch the elephants.such beautiful animals they are. How can men kill them !  Decided last minute to go on a safari and stayed at Sarova game camp, very relaxing place, lovely grounds, great staff and the choices of food were fabulous each day. The driver who took us  about to see the wild animals ,was excellent his-name was Patrick - very good. The first day we saw the big five, I was so excited and happy but sad at the same time, knowing what’s happening to these great animals.

"This report concerns the flight on February 23, 2020.
After a chaotic boarding we took the places 2D and 2J. The AC blew extremely cold and we asked for a blanket, which was completely ignored for more than 10 minutes.
When the older stewardess came with the first load of juice and water, we asked for a glass of sparkling wine and from that point on we were completely ignored. No refreshing towels, no immigration forms, no more drinks - the lady even managed not to smile once during the entire flight.
When I dared to use the toilet, the lady slipped into the toilet in front of me and stayed there for nine minutes!

"I am extremely appalled at the lack of customer service and extreme inefficiencies of Kenya Airways. They create problems without having a way to fix them. My flight through Kenya airways from NBO to SEZ was originally supposed to depart at 12:45pm. Now it’s 2pm and they are saying that my flight from NBO to SEZ is leaving at 17:00 or 5pm. This flight takes at least 3 hours.  The problem is that I booked another flight through Air Seychelles from Mahe Island (SEZ) to Praslin (PRI) that departs at 18:50 or 6:50pm. I checked in for my flight on AirSeychelles on my phone when I landed at NBO. I checked in before Kenya airways told me that my flight would be delayed by 5 hours. As a result of Kenya Airways delay, I am missing a flight that I paid for separately, and essentially Kenya Airways is saying that I will be responsible for the fees involved with missing my Seychelles flight. That includes a no show fee, a rebooking fee and change of reservation fee. So I’m looking at spending an additional $100+ US dollars because Kenya Airways’ flight was delayed almost 5 hours. And Kenya Airways has given me no solution but for me to pay the extra fees and just deal with it.

In addition, if I can’t get a flight in time, I’m losing the cost of accommodation for my first night which is in Praslin.

The women at the customer service desk were even more rude. They began looking at us, passing notes and talking in their language, Looking at us again, and then laughing. I don’t see how our distress caused by your airline is a laughing matter. So long as I can help it, I will never fly Kenya Airways again. And unless they are able to resolve this issue, I would recommend that others avoid Kenya Airways at all costs.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ec/a2/default-avatar-2020-3.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/queenoftrav,Queen wrote a review Feb 2020,Queen,,1 contribution,2 helpful votes,Nairobi - Victoria,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r745638909-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Multiple flight delays - I had to pay extra,Date of travel: February 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I put my name in the hat for the last minute upgrade and was pleased that it my offer was accepted .
check in at ORT was a breeze and the lounge used by KQ is fair and as I later found out on my return leg way better then the KQ lounge in Nairobi.
We were delayed by 20 minutes due to a technical fault with the luggage belts at ORT ( Not a KQ fault!)
But eventually left and service commenced.
Lunch was a rather simple affair and it is sad that the service has been downscaled that much with regards to the meal offering.
The crew was fine and fairly attentive throughout the flight. The 787-9 used was in a neat appearance and kept up well.

Inflight entertainment was pretty poor but for a 4 hour flight it did the trick.
Arrival in NBO was a night mare as premium passengers waited for nearly 50 minutes to get their luggage and only after Economy was offloaded, no apology from the airline and NO ground handling staff present at their own home terminal which was rather poor in my humble view.
However all in all I do enjoy KQ s ethereally try but wish they would polish off the service and on the ground experience a bit more and they be able to give both SAA and Ethiopian a run for their money.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/15/d8/ff/4e/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcS4610,Marc S wrote a review Feb 2020,Marc S,"Ladysmith, South Africa",93 contributions,9 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Nairobi,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r745623419-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Friendliness in the skies but soft product needs polishing as does with inflight and ground service in NBO,Date of travel: December 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I was scheduled to facilitate training for the World Bank in Zambia between January 25th 2020 and 29th. Whilst I was preparing to depart for Zambia I got an urgent request to facilitate another training for the UN IOM Kenya office that was scheduled to start on January 30th from 09.00hrs in Naivasha, which after consultation with my Team, I flatly declined. Then I decided to look for early flights from Lusaka to Nairobi and when I saw one scheduled to depart Lusalka at 02.10hrs to arrive in Nairobi shortly before 06.00hrs I decided to try it. When I floated the idea to my Team, they totally declined terming it suicidal, and they justified it with all sorts of scary stories about KQ being late, cancelling flights and not being reliable. Gosh! I was terrified and convinced that it was suicidal. I prayed over it and decided to take a major risk, which if backfired I was going to not only loose a major reputable client, but also loose my reputation and would even have to end up in Court for breach of contract. It was such a major risk, but I decided to take it anyway and put all my faith on Kenya Airways that I have been flying on for so so many years and had been lucky to have only experienced only two delays. On January 25th at 23:00hrs I took flight KQ 726 seating on my favorite seat 33A at the rear end of the cabin near the wash rooms I hate walking down the aisle from the front to the washrooms. KQ flight 726 departed on schedule with no delay and I took that as a good sign and a good start for by busy super tight itinerary. Got into Lusaka on schedule a night at The Taj Pamodzi departed for Lake Kariba Inns the following day facilitated my training, departed from Kariba on the afternoon of the 29th stayed at the Southern Sun Ridgeway left for the airport at midnight and my heart was beating so fast worrying that this was where it could go so badly wrong if Kenya Airways did not keep time. To my delight KQ 727 Nairobi bound was on time departing at precisely 02.10hrs and arriving in Nairobi almost 10mins earlier than scheduled. My driver to Naivasha was thrilled, and before traffic could build up along the busy Mombasa Road highway, we were on our way along the Southern bypass, arriving at the Great Rift in Naivasha at 08.33hrs. My clients found me completely rested and set for their training. Those among them who knew that I had traveled from Lusaka that same morning could not believe how relaxed I looked. Kudos! Kenya Airways you came through for me at such a critical moment. I chose to trust you literary with my life and you did not disappoint.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/challengecentreken2,Ali Mazoa wrote a review Feb 2020,Ali Mazoa,"Nairobi, Kenya",32 contributions,,Lusaka - Nairobi,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r745161671-Kenya_Airways-World.html,A wonderful experience!,Date of travel: January 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We travelled from Mumbai to Nairobi by KQ 205 on 23 Jan 2020 as part of 25 persons travelling together. Individual bookings were made by us. Apart from people having been in major positions in the Corporate world, we had a former Director from a major airline travelling with us.

The baggage for none of us arrived in Nairobi , we travelled to Amboseli the same day. The baggage next day(24 Jan 2020) was delivered in Nairobi in the office of our travel agent in the morning. Where we requested them to send it to Amboseli and paid for it.





The counter staff(girl) was of no help and categorically said that the airline had no system of compensating. They could only talk about any compensation after 24 hrs of delay. We arrived Nairobi on on the morning of 23 Jan 2020, with scheduled arrival time of 1020 hrs. We finally received the baggage in Amboseli at 1600 hrs on 24 Jan 2020, that also with our initiative. Inspite of our best efforts the Duty Manager was not contactable at the Airport and even later. Our numbers were taken and no one even contacted us. Our Office was in touch with Kenya Airways in Delhi, who were the only ones able to tell us about loading of the baggage in the next flight to Nairobi from Mumbai.



Although when we lodged a complaint regarding the delayed baggage, were told that same would be delivered to our hotel the next morning and would be sent by the early morning flight.

At no stage did we receive any compensation, apart from being put to inconvenience.



We were travelling in Kenya in different places and started back on 29 Jan 2020 by KQ 204 and reached Mumbai on 30 Jan 2020. The staff at the airport in Nairobi had no answers for the delayed baggage compensation.



On flight experience:-



My wife was given seat no 15B on the flight KQ 205 to Nairobi. The seat had no button and could not recline. She called the Air Hostess to tell her that it was uncomfortable, due to her back needed a reclining seat and in case another seat could be given, she came back to say that the flight was full and she would not be in a position to help. She requested for the Flight supervisor, who came, he should be really commended for his non friendly and unprofessional attitude. An experienced and mature man, who had answers to everything, how things could not be done. He was kind enough to give lectures on advantages of not using a reclining seat, a straight seat was good for the back. We had four super specialist Doctors travelling with us, since we were on Kenya Airways flight had to take his advise.She even requested him stating that we have 25 persons travelling on board booked by our company and were ready to pay for the seat in Business Class, since there were seats vacant in the Business Class. He had a prompt reply to say that there was no provision to help her, she could get down in Nairobi and write a mail to Kenya Airways , they would revert and help her out. So much for inflight service and conduct of flight supervisor.



It did not end there. Before boarding the return flight KQ 204 on 29 Jan 2019,told the customer relations at the Airport to check that the seat should be reclining or put a remark that the seat should be fine,since the seat number was the same as 15B. Usual answer to say that they had no system of doing that. This time the seat had the button, but could not be reclined. This apart there was a very inhuman experience, my wife suddenly fell sick and collapsed on the seat. I jumped out of my seat to take help of the Doctor friends sitting two seats away. I told the Air Hostess that the Doctor is going to attend to her she is not well. She was very curt to tell me that I was coming on her way for them to serve others, we had also not taken our meals. Imagine the plight of a sick passenger and the attitude of the crew, if we did not have Doctor friends travelling wth us. Doctors reacted fast and gave her medicine and she slowly started reviving. Meanwhile I called the flight supervisor , Mr Raymond, who at least understood and got the box of medicines and the Doctor was comfortable and said that necessary injections could be given if required, since these were available on board. The Air Hostess did come back and apologise, obviously from the inputs she must have received. Only thing I told her was that even today, I go out of the way to help any accident victim, even on the road. He should do the same on the flight,



I had to personally bear the brunt from everyone, since my company decided to take 25 persons on a tour of Kenya(4 in Business Class and 21 in Economy)and I decided to travel with them, something that I do not do. In this case all were friends and known to me.



I have personally flown enough and have been in the travel business for over 30 years, regrettably it was a nightmare to have taken these flights.



When I meet people anywhere I always tell people that have never had a bad experience and people have always been wonderful. I would not call this a bad experience, anywhere in the world or any airline, at least people are humane. It was totally amiss here.

Kenya is a wondeful country but would advise no one to fly Kenya Airways.

"On recent flight from CDG to NBO there was no Sprite, 7Up or any form of Lemonade. All spirits were unheard of brands. Despite the rear business class being completely empty there was no option to upgrade onboard.
The person who sat next to me in extra legroom economy just came and sat there with no attempt by cabin crew to question this.
Whilst on an internal flight KQ cancelled our flight then wanted to charge $600 yes hundred per person to change to an earlier flight rather than their choice of a later flight.
This is just the latest in an increasing list of failures by this airline to the point that if I can I will now use an alternative",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/49/4f/e7/creelboat.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CreelBoat,CreelBoat wrote a review Feb 2020,CreelBoat,Scotland,80 contributions,37 helpful votes,Paris - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r743551359-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Getting Worse To Point Of Never Again,Date of travel: January 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Flew JNB-NBO-KGL 5-6 Feb 2020; 1st on Dreamliner B787-800 and then Embraer 190 on 2nd leg. Almost on time; first flight fell 25 Minutes late. I had made a low, but successful bid for 2nd leg to be upgraded as it also gave access to Kenya’s Lounge in Nairobi which is good and spacious. Ticket cheap, bought from an online travel company. Kenya Airways have reduced luggage allowance for regional flights, with Silver level in their Flying Blue FFP I eventually managed to get a 2nd, huge suitcase, added to be check-in (first one included in ticket). Check-in, transfers, and communication went fine. Onboard, great service, lots of drinks as there seem to be a Happy Hour going on at afternoon/evening flights. Whenever passengers ordered juice, beer or wine they were instantly handed double up without discussion. I love that attitude. It gives a feeling of luxury. I have experienced this before with KQ (on their Dubai route). Food was good, two options with the possibility to add up more as long stock lasted. FAs were fine. Call bells answered. Duty free sales onboard worked well. The Dreamliner is great but space provided in economy is humiliatingly small. I was lucky to have 3 seats to myself to survive lack of leg and breathing space. Pride lounge in Nairobi is a breeze and I slept well till next morning to catch last leg as being upgraded. Last leg morning flight NBO-KGL was uneventful. Of 9 business class seats (1 x 2 configuration). No complaints apart from a joke of “breakfast” consisting of a tired, reheated croissant. No cheese, only jam to supply. Champagne and coffee/tea given on request.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anderspp,Anders P P wrote a review Feb 2020,Anders P P,,23 contributions,6 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Kigali,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r743532862-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Solid product in economy class,Date of travel: February 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Flew Bangkok-Johannesburg over Nairobi on 5th February 2020. Both flights on newer B787-8 aircrafts. Check-in and luggage handling went smoothly, but had to fight a bit with ground staff to get all my BPs issued on spot. Booking handling online works well. Their AF-KLM lounge offered in Bangkok is poor (like Thai Airways lounges) but their Pride lounge in Nairobi is good and spacious. Hardware on Kenya Airways is good and they are good on ground to tackle even complicated issues. The FAs are also good, plenty, observant. They are mainly Kenyans which does not help Chinese nor Thai passengers much. The very weak point of KQ is the food. Business class does not provide food any better than their Economy class and is plain, without vision, looking shabby. Competing airlines like Ethiopian, Turkish, South African, and Egypt serves much better and inspiring food in their economy class. Steel cutlery and table preparation nice. But that’s it. Dinner from BKK was a cold shabby dish with chopped salad and 3 ridiculous small pieces of sliced meatballs. Breakfast offered was inedible continental or fried rice. Very poor offerings. No meat, no cocktails, no cheeses, no icecream, no smoothies, chocolates, no fruits (watermelon does not count). Extremely poor catering, a disgrace for the airline. Beverages are shamefully very sparse, only 2 juices (apple or orange) are offered. Wines are only passable. Beers are cheap, waterish industrial stuff: 2 brands, Tusker and Heineken – not providing any alternatives to each other. No souvenir, no pyjamas, no luxury feelings at all. No lobster, no seafood, no caviar, no mutton, goat, pork, no beef, no chicken (maybe inside the breakfast sausage).  FA staff admitted that economy class had the same catering as business though of course presented simpler. 1st flight on time, 2nd departed 1 hour late. Miles given quickly to Flying Blue. I will go again when the price is right. Lower expectation to food to zero and eat well at home or in lounge. Then it can be fairly good value for money when prices are promoted.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anderspp,Anders P P wrote a review Feb 2020,Anders P P,,23 contributions,6 helpful votes,Bangkok - Johannesburg,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r743532229-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Food is a joke!,Date of travel: February 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Travelled from dxb to nairobi flight KQ305 on 01/02/2020. The flight was first delayed for like and hour which wasnt a big problem for me. We landed in Jkia safely but issues started when we went for our baggage. We were shocked to be told that our baggage was left in dubai and we were to receive them in like 2days after. They assured us.They promised to deliver my luggage to kisii G4S office in which i went after two days only to find that my luggage was sent to homabay together with other customer luggage. I went a day after again on date 6/2/2020 and i received almost and empty suitcase 💼 which was damage as well. Most of my belongings are lost and i feel so bad to have chosen this thing flight they purport to call African pride. I called the number they had told me in receipt to call incase of any issues with my luggage only to be told i should launch the issue on kq online desk which i hv done and am still waiting for miracles to happen.
This is the worst customer experience and the worst flight ever.

"Kenya Airways is no longer the ""Pride of Africa""but one of the ""Shames of Africa"". Our flight was on a Boeing 787, so a fairly new plane, but it was not at all comfortable, very little leg room!! I would not want to fly to NY on this plane. As usual, the food was just adequate and you feel like you are a burden to the cabin crew. But our troubles started at Kenya Airways check-in. The luggage tags when printed, didn't include the whole bar-code so the automated system didn't know where to send the bags. Of course when we arrived in Windhoek our bags were missing, we did get them 3 days later.
Never really found out why, but also on the return flight all 6 of our bags ( we had to buy more clothes and equipment for our camping trip) went missing and that took 5 days for them to get to us. No apology, nothing...

"By far the worst experience I've ever had, and I'm a fair reviewer.  On a trip from Zanzibar to Cape Town, connecting through Nairobi, there was a ""mechanical issue"" with the plane. They didn't tell ANY of the passengers, instead they escorted everyone to a random room in the airport and left us. I repeat, NO NOTIFICATION.  Most of the passengers at their waiting for instruction but thankfully Expedia sent me a text notification so I went out and rescheduled a different flight while everyone else sat there.  I got to Nairobi at 4am and got another flight to Cape Town.  The ticket said it's a direct flight, but it wasn't until we got on the plane that they said it was connecting through victoria falls.  When we landed in victoria falls we sat on the tarmac for an hour and then guess what, ANOTHER MECHANICAL issue, on the flight we were JUST ON  The next flight out of Victoria falls to Cape Town was 2 DAYS LATER. I got off and booked a flight through South African airlines. Avoid this airline at all costs.  Trust me.

"All flights were on time and there was no issue with my bags. It was easy to use the self-service check in machine at the airport. Generally I didn't have any problem with my trip, but there was a lack of extra touches. Most of airlines for long haul flights they provide a bunch of extras like slippers, toothbrash, a menu to choose meal etc. Kenya airways hasn't reach that level of service. Even the staff members, they were OK, but far away from a 5-star customer service. Nairobi airport (JKIA) is not the most pleasant place to have a long layover.

"I was trying to fly using miles with several airlines for our trip to Nairobi, but all entailed at least one transfer and the timing didn’t work out for our charter flight.  We decided to splurge and go business class on Kenya Airways for this once in a lifetime trip. They had a sale going on, so that definitely helped!  They are the only airline that has direct flights between JFK and Nairobi. The flights were both on time, the service was very nice, and the seats were very comfortable.  I actually slept on the way back for 8 hours straight, which I never do on a plane!  The food was fine- nothing amazing- but I don’t really expect it to be. I did have a vegetarian dinner on the way back that was quite good. They have only been offering this direct flight for a few years now and they fly the 787-8 Dreamliner, which is a nice aircraft. It seems a little quieter than other jets and the inflight movie selection was extensive. It was so great not having to transfer.

"Worst airline ive everflown ! I flew from Entebbe, to Nairobi, then to New York. My final destination was Toronto (from New York to toronto I flew Delta ) .  I Lost 3 ipads, a phone , cologne which were all in my checked in bag; - missed my connection  flight in newyork bcoz KQ delayed in Nairobi for more than 3 hours- lost my luggage and when I called KQ , I couldnt get anyone to talk to. Their help desk in NY is completely deserted for most of the day. I even inquired from a Delta rep and he told me that every single day, they get about 40 KQ travelers who have been displaced n screwed up by their airlines , so delta airlines ends  up being forced to fixed KQ's mess , including lost luggages,  every single day. Smh.On a 15hr flight, we were only served food once. Not only was the food so little , but it was also crappy n tasted like raw duck.! When you ask for tea, coffee or even juice , the flight attendants will take like 30min to serve you, not forgetting their nasty attitude. Plus they serve you coffee in baby cups, meant for 3 yr old toddlers.Arriving in NewYork, more than half of the passengers either had some or all their suitcases missing. Upon inquiry, we were told that most of the suitcases hadn't even left Nairobi.🤯! So I lost my gadgets , cologne , phone , and god knows what !

"Where to begin... Business class flights London to Kilimanjaro via Nairobi. With an 8 hour lay over in Nairobi. Service on the plane was very much “couldn’t care less” I asked for red wine with my meal,they had 2 small bottles on board for everyone to share, no white wine at all, not one of the cabin crew could care less about delivering any sort of service. The entertainment system and content are so poor there is literally nothing worth turning it on for. When we came to board the flight from Nairobi to Kilimanjaro we were informed that the plane had been changed, as a result we had been downgraded to economy, and handed our new boarding passes. It is only an hours flight, not the end of the world, after much arguing they eventually gave us forms to claim back the difference in cost at least ( that fight is still to come).Arrived on time at Kilimanjaro, despite the 8 hour layover only one of our bags had made the journey with us!!!!! They could not care less, it was put onto a later flight, we were travelling four hours away, and we had to make arrangements to collect the bag ourselves, they totally washed their hands of any responsibility.

This experience could have ruined a wonderful 2 week holiday if we had let it.

"Something's fishy in the cargo practices at Kenya Airways and JamboJet.

The 'weight imbalance' excuse to leave all passenger luggage off your flights but then send the luggage on other flights AND then deliver each luggage to each passengers final destination days later is a scam.

This is not a sustainable profit making plan for Kenya Airways. It appears that a corrupt cartel in Kenya Airways is profiting by diverting funds to cargo and shipping/transportation companies that they own or have interests in.

You're also severely inconveniencing and frustrating your passengers.

All other airlines manage to estimate their loads (passenger, fuel, cargo) seamlessly all day, every day!!

"I arrived in London on a direct flight from Nairobi on Saturday 11 Jan 2010 only to find that my bag was missing. Very unusual on a direct flight and disappointing to myself and the over 20 other people who were similarly affected.

I filed a missing bag report on the same day of arrival and was promised that my bag would be delivered on Sunday. I spent most of Sunday waiting for my bag but it was not delivered and I was not informed that my bag would not be delivered. .

On Monday and Tuesday I tried to arrange a convenient delivery time with City bags luggage (appointed by Kenya Airways to deliver baggage) but to no avail. Unsurprisingly I am at work all day. City bags luggage were unable/unwilling to deliver my bag except during working hours (9 - 5 pm). I requested a friend assist and he made himself available after 4 pm on Wednesday. City bags luggage again, were unable/unwilling to exercise any flexibility. Luckily the delivery was made after 4 pm but the driver refused to deliver into the building and insisted that his instructions were to leave the bag by the kerb. My friend had to collect my bag from the parking area.

I cc'd Kenya Airways on conversations I had with City bags luggage but no-one contacted me.

This is not the first time I have had an airline forget my bag, but this is my worst experience. Overall very stressful, disappointing, and customer unfriendly. Kenya Airways, should passengers be prepared to take a day off work to wait for a bag delivery and also go to the parking area to collect it?",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/fe/default-avatar-2020-58.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mossyf2020,Mossy F wrote a review Jan 2020,Mossy F,,1 contribution,2 helpful votes,Nairobi - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r739294090-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Baggage left behind on a direct flight!,Date of travel: January 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"first time flying on this carrier, not impressed. had a 3 and half hour delay followed with another3/4 delay in nairobi, for missing connection. Not very nice when travelling with three children under 5 ! The staff on the flights (four flights were taken during the 3 week trip) we found were on the whole friendly, but not very attentive.
Not much information was given to passengers.
The food on the flights was terrible and most of us ate crackers or other snacks bought on the ground!
Seats were very narrow we found though leg room was ok, as we were given basinet seats, the seats were very old and the cushioning was finished so not at all comfortable, I had to sit on a pillow to get some cushioning.

As the attendant started cleaning ( with no gloves using the facial tissues ..... again low low hygiene - this was the same person who was serving the cabin food and drinks - sis ) , his supervisor told him to leave it alone and not clean and leave it to whoever wanted to use the loo to clean .KQ gets worse not better with each flight.

"This was my first time travelling on Kenya Airways and after reading many reviews I was very apprehensive.  Because we booked last minute we did not have much choice and tickets were much more reasonably priced than Emirates.  I downloaded the app but was not permitted to check in online. We were supposed to have a hour wait between flights but airline was delayed by half and hour. The aircraft was clean but as far as the staff are concerned, in all my years of travelling I have never come across such unfriendly stewardesses. They were rude and abrupt.  I thought it was maybe a once off but on the flight from Nairobi to Dubai and on both return sectors they were extremely rude and abrupt. I was actually scared to ask for water as I saw how rude they were to other passengers as well.

I don't want to complain about the child that screamed and wasn't quiet for 5 minutes, because it's not the cabin crew's fault.

"Never had such a bad experience with any airline before. They tag themselves as they ‘The pride of Africa’ and should immediately remove that as they are nothing but a disgrace to this lovely continent. We had 4 flights with them in a span on 15 days and out of which 3 were delayed for more than 10 hours each. First time, the machine failed and people had to wait overnight at the airport, second time they had shortage of crew and then their systems failed again and gave us hand written boarding passes?!  The airline had no sense of apology for the same. The staff is probably the most arrogant people I have met in my life as they are the least interested in providing service and do not care about keeping the passengers satisfied. They made excuses to even serve water that ‘they had too many passengers left to serve’. Travelling with Kenya airways was the biggest mistake of this wonderful trip I took to South Africa and I ended up spending more than 700 dollars per person to get hotel stays, etc due to their delays for which I did not even get a penny back.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mahikaac,Mahika wrote a review Jan 2020,Mahika,,1 contribution,2 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Mumbai,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r737055079-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Never travel by this airline,Date of travel: January 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"On a flight from Nairobi to Malindi, KQ (Jambojet) somehow managed to leave half of the flight’s luggage in Nairobi, and claimed that because that was the last flight of the day there was nothing they could do until the following day. Come the next afternoon, we hadn't heard anything so we called KQ. A guy picked up the phone and told us he'd call back, he did not. We called again an hour later only to be told the bag had arrived and WE must come collect it. After going back and forth on the phone arguing that it is their job to deliver the luggage to us we just decided to hire a cab to go collect it and bring it to us. Conclusion, we ended up paying more money for an inconvenience caused  to us by KQ! Absolutely ridiculous, KQ, shameful. Good service would have ensured the passengers with lost luggage are compensated with convenience if not actually money! If I could rate negative I would.

The honest impression is that the airline is barely hanging on. There is clear evidence of poor maintenance within the aircraft with non reclining or poorly reclining seats and other things that are poorly functional. The cabin crew are doing their best to keep smiling against a backdrop of less than average offerings within the flight. Obviously and as usual the flight did not leave on time. It remains a big wonder why this airline is always much more expensive compared to others.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/63/avatar041.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellyn2014,ELLY NYAIM O wrote a review Dec 2019,ELLY NYAIM O,"Nairobi, Kenya",30 contributions,4 helpful votes,Entebbe - Nairobi,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r733238883-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Regional flight,Date of travel: December 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Absolutely horrible service and with it scarred from traveling. Never ever fly with them. We booked our tickets online directly from Kenya Airways on the 2nd of November and on the 8th of November the money was deducted from my credit card. We saw that one of the flights directly after booking was cancelled and we phoned the airlines. They said we shouldn't worry and that we will receive an e-ticket after the cancelled flight has been fixed but till then our booking reference number will be fine. On the 15th we were suppose to fly at 23:00. At check-in the woman told as there's a problem and we have to go to ticket sales. At ticket sales they confirmed our booking and payment but noticed our tickets were never issued. We weren't alone 5 other had similar problems but since they booked through travel agents there's could be sorted out within the very last minute. My boyfriend and I missed the flight. Kenya's excuse were they never recieved confirmation of our payment. The next day at 7am we started phoning them. When they finally answered they did this thing where after they told us to hold they would end the line. By the fourth call my boyfriend warned them if they are going go to end the line again he will lose it. The woman confirmed that we could fly at 14:30. We phoned three more times to follow up. After 10am we were back at the airport at ticket sales. Same problem no answer, no ticket and no help from Kenya Airways. At 12:30 we got the news that we only have two options they refund our ticket (but also not immediately) and we have to pay for more expensive tickets and no compensation or we should take a refund. After spending R300 on Uber, R400 on airtime to phone to Kenya and all the other small travel expenses we took the refund and now missed our holiday and our paid accommodation. Please please please don't fly with Kenya Airways. It's not uncommon for bad things to happen but they happen frequently according to other reviews with Kenya Airways rather than it going well.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lienels,Lien wrote a review Dec 2019,Lien,,1 contribution,7 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Zanzibar Island,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r733214071-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Stay Away,Date of travel: December 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The planes, pilots and crews are fine. Adequate, I guess. They do not, however, have the slightest clue with regard to flight scheduling or keeping scheduled flights on time. This is where things go badly wrong, and the resultant mayhem is why you should avoid this airline at all cost.

We recently flew with Kenya Airways from Cape Town to Zanzibar. Our departure was scheduled for 11pm but, after an initial cancellation and later reinstatement of the flight, we eventually left for Zanzibar at 3.30am. We obviously missed our connecting (also Kenya Airways) flight to Zanzibar and had to endure a full day in Nairobi at a second rate hotel - which took an hour to get to in a clapped out bus. Back at the Nairobi airport that evening, our booking had disappeared from their check-in system. It took us three trips to their own ticket office in the same building before we were finally issued with boarding passes. The service was shockingly poor and incompetent.

When we finally got to Zanzibar late that night, after a 12 hour delay, they had managed to lose our luggage. Three days later, and after having had to spend $400 to buy some clothes and toiletries, we received our luggage. But the clincher is that the bags stood at Zanzibar airport for a day before they finally got in touch. We had to pay for another transfer to have it collected - turns out they don't deliver your luggage when they incompetently lose it.

We have yet to receive an apology from anyone. I don't expect any.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adriaan23,adriaan23 wrote a review Dec 2019,adriaan23,"Paarl, South Africa",2 contributions,5 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Zanzibar Island,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r732988951-Kenya_Airways-World.html,The embarrassment of Africa.,Date of travel: December 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Travelled from jhb to Nairobi, plane was delayed coming into jhb therefore we missed our connecting flight to zanzibar from Nairobi we had to spend 8 hours waiting and missed a whole day at our hotel in zanzibar. Low and behold on our return trip we climbed on the airplane at Zanzibar expecting (which was also delayed) to fly directly to Nairobi, we got a little surprise whilst in the air that we were stopping in dar es salaam, only on landing in dar es salaam we were told why we stopped in dar es salaam (it was to take on passengers that were in a broken down Kenyan airways flight) this was completely against our itinerary and resulted in all passengers missing their connecting flights. Once again we are stuck at the airport for hours on end waiting for the next flight back home.

The air Kenya staff were unapologetic and didnt seem to know what was going on themselves.

"I flew from JFK to London via Delta.  Delta then booked me on Kenya Airways from London to Nirobi.  When I arrived in Nairobi my luggage was badly damaged.  Delta informed me Kenya Airwas was responsible for repairs, replacement or compensation.  I took the bag to Kenya Airways Ya Ya Centre office and was promised it would be repair or resolved within 10 days.  Four weeks later, after numerous visits to the YaYa office to check on their progress, I was offered $30US minus 10% for a bag that was 17 days old.  I then asked for return of the bag and was informed the bag had never left the YaYa center.  I did not receive the bag until the day I was scheduled to leave.  The bag was badly damaged and I had to pay for tape and glue to get it to the airport and then wrapping.  Adding insult to injury I was unable to us DHL because we did not know what would have to go in the DHL package until we received the bag and then it was too late.  I then had to pay an additional overweight fee.  But the problem does not end there, once I returned home, the damaged bag did not arrive.  I had flown Delta from Paris to my home city.  At first I was told by Delta the bag had only been checked to JFK.  I had to explain even though I had flown out of JFK, it was not my final return destination.  I received my bag the next day with further damage and items broken inside.  Both Delta and Kenya Airways provided no assistance during my many visits to inquire about the bag.  Delta also repeatedly told me it was not their responsibility as Kenya Airways was the last to handle the bag.  This ticket was booked through Delta's website and I am a frequent flyer member.

"Automatic three points as the flights were all on time, and my luggage made it, though not in one piece.

The overly-officious gate agent for Madagascar Ground Handling, who handled the ticketing for my Antananarivo-Nairobi flight, insisted on my checking a second piece of luggage (despite a third of the flight's bins being empty). When I received the luggage a vase in the interior of the case was broken into 30 pieces. Obviously the luggage was thrown around and had other pieces of luggage on top of it. Nice work (sarcasm) Madagascar Ground Handling!

Great gate agents in Nairobi, and I appreciated an agent named Festus who accommodated my exit row issues.

Flight back was uneventful, though the flight attendants were unresponsive and listless.

"We flew from Cape Town to Bangkok via Nairobi a while back and apart from the very long 8 hours layover in Nairobi both ways, it was a pleasant experience. The onboard staff were friendly and helpful, and food were totally satisfactory compared to the larger airlines.

The Nairobi airport was unfortunately not a great place to wait around in. We booked into one of the very expensive airport lounges on the return trip to get some sleep. Cost around $40 each admittance, and was disappointed to find that they didn’t have suitable beds in their resting room.

We would definitely recommend flying Kenyan airlines if you don’t mind the long layover times and the not so user friendly airport in Nairobi.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianayg2016,dianayg2016 wrote a review Dec 2019,dianayg2016,"Betty's Bay, South Africa",33 contributions,44 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Bangkok,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r731619422-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Verrrrry long layovers but good airline service,Date of travel: October 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I was scheduled to leave Bangui for Nairobi and then spend a night in Nairobi before flying to Paris. As indicated by Kenya airways representatives at the airport, the flight from Bangui was cancelled due to technical reason.

The representatives at the airport were uninformed and unable to provide basic information concerning follow-on flights and any compensation due to inconveniences caused by the cancellation (for instance hotel room and any follow-on reservation already reserved in Nairobi and at the final destination). We were told to comeback at the airport the following day at 1500 to all get on the next flight. We were also told that if any earlier flight would be available, that we would be contacted by phone.

That evening I contacted by phone Kenya Airways and was told that I was in fact already scheduled to leave the next day early in the morning and not at 1500 (as confirmed by their representative). The KQ representative never called me to inform me that I should present myself earlier. Had I not dealt with this by myself, I would have missed my re-routing flight.

With the flight cancellation:
- I arrived to my final destination over 20 hours late.
-I had to wait 12 hours in Douala for my connecting flight (where Kenya airways did not even provide me with a 10$ voucher or something to recognize the long layover) - I did not benefit from any of the service provided by Kenya airways representatives in Bangui, as again, they provided me initially with inaccurate information and then were totally absent in following-up with an update.

When I did a compensation claim for this travel, Kenya airways inform me that they could only issue me a 100$ voucher that can only be used to travel with them again, or pay for their lounge or excess luggage (which is clearly what I will avoid doing in the future). This voucher is not going to even cover the basic cost of my delay (loss hotel reservation, money spent at the airport for the 12 hours layover etc).

Highly disappointed in the customer service of this company. If you fly with them make sure you have great insurance (they themselves asked me to contact my individual travel insurer for recompense as they would not do anything).

"I've been flying KQ to Nairobi for business since 2015. First started with them after I couldn't deal anymore with Ethiopian Airlines' normal 2 am arrival time in Nairobi (getting people to come and pick you up in the pre-Uber days always involved more effort than I could deploy). I started with them with much trepidation initially, but 4 years down the line, I must say that they have done very well, so far.

Flight attendants are of variable quality, some make it seem as if they would rather be elsewhere; some are friendly and professional. Pilots are generally good - I travel around in Europe fairly frequently and would say KQ pilots measure up to what I've experienced there. One major gripe is the old -looking planes and poor in-flight entertainment options - only flown an newish KQ plane once when they put a Dreamliner on the Lagos-Nairobi route. Food is of variable quality per flight, but again as far as I am concerned all airline food is generally lousy. Taking another KQ flight in February - I understand the Kenyan government is taking the airline over again next year - so will watch the airline a while after February to see how its fortunes develop.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LegalTranslating,Legal Translator wrote a review Dec 2019,Legal Translator,,5 contributions,,Lagos - Antananarivo,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r730376245-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Reasonably good experience with KQ so far,Date of travel: November 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Flew with Kenya Airways on two legs of a four leg trip. I flew from Johannesburg to Nairobi, and then on to Paris. Staff were friendly and professional throughout, from the check in desks, via the lounges and onto the aircraft. I have to say that the business lounges are superb, beautifully laid out and a HUGE variety of food and drink on offer to suit all tastes. The leg from Nairobi to Paris was overnight so the seats almost fully reclined to enable a pleasant sleep. Meals on board were very good too. If there is one minor criticism it is that the entertainment was rather limited compared to other international airlines, but when you are asleep for much of the journey it doesn't really impact on the experience. It was rather a culture shock to arrive in Paris and find that the business lounge (Air France) was awful and have written to them separately.

The operate the flight at their convenient time, they provide the seats which they wish, even though other seats are free. They food will be worse the food in railway platforms.

"Outbound flight was in economy, offered the basics, no frill - okay seats, okay space, kindly professional staff, regular non-exceptional meal, usual extras like blankets, earphones etc provided. Was not overly busy and the airport is ok too. Felt safe and got my value for money.

The best part of the flying experience was the option to auction for business class upgrade on the return flight (I believed was great value purchase). Typically the attendants were more smiley and courteous in that carriage, the food was better, the reclining seats made for a great sleep, the toiletry bag had socks and a sleep mask, toothbrush & toothpaste - nothing outstanding yet no complaints... while it was not over the top (extravagant / lavish), the trip was a pleasant flight and well worth the extra fee.

"KQ has updated their fleet and has come a long way over the years.  They have many convenient schedules in Africa, and now a direct flight to JFK from Nairobi.  The 737-800 overnight service from Cape Town departs at 11 pm; an overnight flight to Nairobi.  One would think a business class seat would be comfortable; sadly, it was not. The seat reclines, but the footrest is useless (it is nothing like a lay flat experience).

"I have over the years been happy travelling on KQ flights. I have been a Frequent Flyer Gold Member for many years but the service keeps dropping. I know KQ is making a loss but they do not get more passengers by providing less and less service.
As a main rule KQ Customer Care does not reply customers, the system of having miles credited automatically does not work and now KQ has decided not to serve refreshment on flights between Nairobi and Kilimanjaro (schedules for a 60 minutes flight).
In November I flew to Johannesbourg with KQ and our baggage was delayed and some items missing. Only after serveral reminders and forwarding of the complaints to a staff I know in KQ HQ did KQ respond - in November.
On the out-bound flight to Nairobi we were notified that the flight was delayed by 2 hours so we arrived at the airport at 1½ hour before the new time of departure. After check-in we went to the Business Class Lounge to have lunch but before we even started eating it was announced that the flight would leave a lot earlier than scheduled.

"We enjoyed our flight on Kenya Airways, from MRU to Nairobi (flight from Nairobi to AMS was operated by KLM), from Amsterdam to Nairobi, and a third flight from Nairobi to MRU.
The crew members are smiling and very nice. The best part was the food; fresh and tasty. Even the desserts were yummy.
The only issue is that we had only 1 hour transit in Nairobi, and as the fight was delayed, we had only 30 minutes to board the other flight to go to AMS.
Our luggages didn't arrive, as apparently the crew didn't have enough time to board the luggages.
However, the staff in Amsterdam from KLM was very nice, and told us our luggages would arrive on next flight.
So I recommend to transit at least 2hrs+ to ensure that your luggage arrives with you.
Otherwise, this didn't spoil our vacation.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/10dede,10dede wrote a review Nov 2019,10dede,Mauritius,64 contributions,49 helpful votes,Mahebourg - Nairobi,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r725723009-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Good flight and good food.,Date of travel: November 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"When booking our flight we paid a large amount extra to ensure extra leg room as my partner is quite tall so finds long flights very uncomfortable in standard seats. We were sat in front of a bulkhead which was fine, but we then found that as the lady in thr seat next to us had a small baby she would need the cot that KA provide. These hang on the bulkhead. At this point the member of crew asked us if we would be using our in flight entertainment while flying because once the cot is in place the screen cannot be put up. We said we did want it, it was an 8 hour flight so entertainment was needed! Once the screen was up we found ourselves to be completely trapped in our seats. There was no way to get out without either taking down the entire cot or asking the lady next to us to move so we could clamber over the seats (which we didnt like to do as she was travelling alone and the situation was not at all her fault). To summarise, we had the choice of being bored for the flight but being able to get to the toilet, or to watch films and be stuck in our seats.
The health implications of not being able to freely move are obvious, as is the safety concern should there be an emergency evacuation with no time to remove the cot etc! This situation would have been annoying at the standard price but having paid significantly more, we were no better off than in a standard seat.

We also found the entertainment system control to be damaged in one of our seats.

Once home we tried to contact KA through the recommended channels regarding the matter. We followed this up with a further email asking for someone to get back to us. To date, 7 weeks since we flew, no response has been recieved.

On a plus note, staff on board were polite and the food was edible.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/19/20/5a/ba/evolvetraveller.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EvolveTraveller,Sarah wrote a review Nov 2019,Sarah,,9 contributions,3 helpful votes,Nairobi - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r724745554-Kenya_Airways-World.html,"Poor, unsafe",Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I flew from Geneva to Zanzibar and back via Nairobi. I fly often, on long hauls I usually fly Singapore Airlines un so I am quite demanding. Kenya Airways was a good surprise!
AIRCRAFT from Geneva was good but not remarkable. From Nairobi to Zanzibar, Embraer 190 was brand new and despite it is a small aircraft, each seat had its own screen.
FOOD was good, on every flight was proposed a choice of 3 meals one of which vegetarian (so a choice of 3 hot meals on the Geneva Nairobi and back, and on the 1h10min flight from Nairobi to Zanzibar there was a choice of 3 sorts of sandwiches). My daughter had a CHILD'S MEAL that she really enjoyed, nothing spicy like we got on other airlines (Emirates) but chicken potatoes and vegetables on first flight and lasagne on another flight (one child's meal picture is in attachment). She even received a special sandwich on short flights to and from Zanzibar.
WINE was from South Africa, pretty good.
All flights were ON TIME or landed earlier than scheduled.
Lovely STAFF, generous, they were regularly crossing the aircraft offering drinks and asking is anything was needed.
QUALITY for PRICE is surely excellent!
NEGATIVE points:
1. Nairobi airport is quite small and if you have a long stopover there is no much to do.
2.The sound of my entertainment program did not work on the flight back.
3.

"Kenya Airways fly direct to and from Nairobi every day.Whilst originally not my first choice (at time of booking British Airways were undertaking a series of strike actions) I was pleasantly surprised with Kenya Airways.  They have a modern fleet of planes including the lovely 787 Dreamliner and the staff are friendly and efficient.  The booking and check in process is relatively pain free and when I changed my flight back to the UK, although I had to pay a charge to do so, the information on how to do so was clear and concise and efficient.

We hear that engine we failing and they are fixing it . Then electric power suddenly dropped off , they restarted it again and then the engineer sitting behind me was called . What happen : captain board failed . When trying to fix this situation, they discovered by chance fuel leakage!!!

They closed the curtain as if it is going to stop me hearing them . Then they announced after complete 2 hours in the plain that we need to disembark because the above reason and they are going to change the aircraft.
When disembarking every one saw the fuel leaking as if you opened tap wanted in kitchen . Fireman truck was in place too . I asked one of the employees. At what time we will embark in the new craft . He says 11h30 Kenya time . Ok . I took my belongings and went back to lounge to work . And watching the aircraft been repaired fireman covering the fuel on tarmac with foam and waiting for the next flight . Ok 11 30 they announced it will be at 2 pm ok stress , and fatigue are going night . Any other option flightier Dakar : NO . Then I see that we will embark in the same gate where the first flight is still standing.
Kenya airways didn’t keep its word on changing the aircraft but stick to the same . I asked the attendees are we embarking to the same flight he said yes , the captain talk to everyone and reassured everyone that the aircraft has been fixed . IS THAT ENOUGH GUARANTEE FOR YOU !!

Lot of people refused to embark. But the company didn’t give choice as saying next flight in in 3 days . So all these people are rubbish for you you don’t care on their security .
Finally to take of and it was past 3pm .
When we entered the turbulence zone . That was the extreme mental torture. As you really don’t know if it is the plane or turbulence. People were on there nerve .

Since Friday every time I close my eyes I only see and here that turbulence time . A real trauma .

Addition to this the flight in business class even are crappy not confortable and not to standard to the price paid .

This was the return sector of our flight out to Kenya. Having spent 2 hours in the business class lounge where found it comfortable and spacious. The food selection was poor however with what little there was on offer running out. The flight left on time with us being offered a glass of juice or water. The seats were flatbeds and everything was in working order. We had the two seats by the windows. Service throughout the daylight flight was good with the food being fairly average. The flight arrived on time and we disembarked at terminal 4.

"I took this flight a few weeks ago and gave it a lower rating. And the drawbacks are still there (no TSA pre-check, lounge a long way from the gate, small TV screens compared to other business class, the meanest amenity kit of any business class I have ever flown), but truly superb service from the moment I stepped inside and was welcomed, to the farewell at the end of a 14 hour flight, was phenomenal: always anticipating my needs, offering and helping to make the flight the best it could be.

"I traveled return from Dubai to Cape Town.
On the way to Cape Town we had no delays and the staff were friendly, but not overly friendly (particularly the trip from Nairobi to Cape Town (via Livingston) but Dubai to Nairobi was excellent. The breakfast in the lounge was not great, but the food on the aircraft I found really good.

On the flight back to Dubai (via Nairobi) i was aware and prepared for an 8 hour lay over in Nairobi (when I say prepared I mean I had my netflix all downloaded and ready to go)
The flight itself was great to Nairobi. I settled down into the Pride lounge for my 8 hour layover. I didnt manage to make it into the ""sleeping area"" as it was always full... but I found a couch and set up camp for the day.
the staff were lovely and again the food was average, not a huge variety to choose from, but filled the gap and had good drinks and coffee to help.
the flight was then delayed by a further 5.5 hours ... which took my layover to whole new levels... luckily I managed to sleep, but was overly frustrating as I had to work the next morning so an arrival at 1:30 am when you had planned to arrive at 8:30 pm is a bit krappy... but I know its no ones fault there was a ""technical"" issue.

"This is the worst airline that we have been on, and we travel quite often. Arriving at the airport, we were refused boarding because my husband did not have a visa to Mauritius. We explained that we don't need a visa as we have been to the country a couple of times before, but they were brutal, harsh,the kids were crying as we were going as a family. We had booked 3 months before and if we knew how Kenya Airways is, we would have applied for that visa as we had enough time for it. They did not phone Mauritian Consular but instead they phone Nairobi who said no boarding. It was a sad flight for a family going on holiday. Arriving in Mauritius I explained the situation to the customs officer who told me that they should not have done that ! I had to go to the Immigration Department which gave me an official letter and send it to them saying that he can come to Mauritius without a visa, the mauritian people were very nice and professional. He came after a couple of days without paying any extras that they asked us to pay but we refused as it was their fault. The experience was distressing, I contacted the Kenya Airways without any response...STAY AWAY PEOPLE, this airline as well as the country needs staff training. They are cheap but they will cost you more after. Even though you don't need a visa, make sure that you phone them before booking with them as they will take it upon themselves to decide if you need a visa or not. My husband went somewhere else in Africa with Kenya Airways where he did not need a visa, but because of this experience, he applied for one anyway!  If you can pay a little bit more and avoid Kenya Airways, do it, otherwise make sure that you get a visa, phone the Kenya Airways and not the country you are traveliing to. REALLY REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE...without mentioning the state of the plane from Kenya to Mauritius which was as dispressing as the experience.

"Kenya Airways is by far the worst airline I have ever travelled with. I am a frequent flyer with budget airlines so my expectations are low. During my 6 weeks holiday to Tanzania and Madagascar I had 5 flights with Kenya Airways. 3 flights were heavily delayed without explanation, 1 flight was cancelled due to overbooking, we had to de-board one plane due to a system malfunction on preparing for take off and board another, only for the replacement to also require work from the engineering team. They lost our luggage for 5 days during our transfer from Tanzania to Madagascar. The general service is poor, with most of the staff being uninterested and incompetent. The 'food' was disgusting.

"Flying from Perth to Nairobi I chose air Mauritius from Perth to Mauritius. Connecting to Kenya airways from Mauritius to Nairobi. On one ticket.
There was only about an hour and
A half transit. Both Kenya airways and air Mauritius confirmed this was long enough to transfer myself and my luggage which had been booked straight through from Perth.
At the transit desk I requested they check to see if my luggage had been transferred. I was told Kenya airways said they had my luggage, my two cases had already been transferred.
On arriving in Nairobi my cases were nowhere to be seen.
Kenya airways help desk advised me they had received an email from Kenya Airways Mauritius sayings my luggage had not made the transfer? I had been assured in Mauritius it was already loaded.
The lady at the Kenya airways desk in Nairobi - it’s now nearly midnight and passengers were exhausted. - advised my cases would be delivered the following morning.
They didn’t bother calling me but the apartments I was staying at to advise them my cases had been left behind again.
I was lied to twice by Kenya Airways.
I had to go out and buy clothes and toiletries which I shouldn’t have had to purchase if my cases had arrived on time.
I was advised by Kenya airways they would not compensate me for these goods.
Only if your cases go missing for 21 days will they consider compensation!
This is not the first time they have left my luggage behind. I’ve had my bags broken into and items taken. My relatives have also had the same experience. They refused to compensate for items not arriving. In fact their office in South Africa is dreadful - extremely rude employees.
When the manager at the serviced apartments I’m staying at heard my luggage did not arrive he immediately said you must have flown Kenya airways. Apparently many of their guests have had similar experiences.
I wanted to cancel my next flight as it’s on Kenya Airways. They won’t give a full refund if any!
My advice to anyone flying if you value your luggage give Kenya Airways a miss until they get a grip of their poor management, lying staff light fingered staff
Also I’ll add the flight from Mauritius business class is really bad. The seats are recliners not flat bed and it’s a long flight, very uncomfortable. Only two choices of food fish or mutton!
The staff on the flight were kind and thoughtful which is negated by the poor ground staff.
I had requested wheelchair assistance which they confirmed - I had to wait three quarters of an hour on board while they looked for a wheelchair.
They need to update the aircraft on that stretch of the flight. Or drop their prices.

"Is this the worst airline in the world or at least the worst in Africa? It depends on the assessment criteria of course but after a recent experience in Sierra Leone flying to Accra in Ghana I'd say it well deserves the title.
First let me confirm that it was equipment failure [the left engine] that stopped the flight and with that I have no problem at all - I'd rather be alive and late than dead in the air on time. So for safety they get a big tick; though conversations among other stranded passengers might suggest that these problems occur so frequently for KQ as to question the thoroughness of Kenya Airways maintenance schedules.
It is not the ordinary on time scheduled performance by which an airline should be judged but rather how they handle a problem or crisis. I could provide chapter and verse, if this review space allowed for such specifics, as to how badly they performed - no customer care, almost non existent communication, no systematic response, no evidence of organization and process - it was chaos from the outset. Such might, at a very long stretch be excusable in the crisis of the initial moment, but the chaos persisted all through the next day when they'd had overnight and 24 hours to get things sorted [and i don't mean in repairing the plane - i mean in taking care of their customers].
Constantly they misled, prevaricated, offered contradictory advice and information, made promises they couldn't possibly have managed, withheld information, undertook to contact everyone the next day by a particular time and no contact at that time or ever was received, botched arrangements for overnight accommodation and transport to and from ..... the list of systemic failures is endless.
Everything that happened was avoidable - we suffered the consequences of 'just in time thinking' - it is obvious that Kenya Airways have no plans or systems in place for such a predictable emergency, or if they do then they don't know how to implement them. We were assured from the outset that they were in touch with head office in Nairobi so one can only assume that the incompetence displayed reaches to the very top of the organization.
By now the reader may be thinking 'well you get what you pay for'. And pay I certainly did - this was a premier world ticket [their business class] and it cost for the 2 hour flight about 4 times what a similar length flight on any one of 6 major airlines in Europe would cost. [Yes the legroom and food and cleanliness on Board were fine but they pale into insignificance besides the demonstrated witless response to a problem]
Most alarmingly chaos prevailed even when we finally got on a flight 28 hours later - I heard passengers being told by the cabin crew and Pursar as they came on board to just sit anywhere as the boarding passes for the flight didn't match. I am not sure what the passenger manifest signed off by KQ for that flight represented but it would seem not to have borne much connection to the human contents of the flight.
You might have perhaps expected this review to end by advising that there was some follow up from the company, some check that things had got sorted, perhaps an apology, because their PR spiel says that we are valued customers and they want us to fly with them again - and they do know our names and our contact details after all. Not a word, not a call, not a text message, not an email, not a general tweet - just silence!
Kenya Airways call themselves the ""Pride of Africa"" - if I was an African Nation I would be insisting they stop bringing the name of Africa into disrepute.
So my advice - Avoid if you can and if you can't expect the worst and you won't be disappointed.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ec/3d/default-avatar-2020-1.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulmQ3826RS,Paul M wrote a review Oct 2019,Paul M,"Adelaide Hills, Australia",1 contribution,1 helpful vote,Freetown - Accra,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r719395476-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Avoid if you can!,Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We missed our 8.30am Kenya Airways flight (the airlines fault, not ours) from Nairobi to Kilimanjaro. The staff at Kenya Airways desk initially insisted that we would have to pay the full fare for a new flight at 5.00pm. When we refused to do so they said there were Business Class seats available on the 1.30pm flight which we could have if we paid the difference between Economy and Business. With reluctance we asked what the difference in price would be. The Kenya Airways staff member said she had checked the price difference twice on screen and it would be $US210 per person. We agreed to pay the difference on the basis that we would dispute the cost later with Kenya Airways. In order to create a paper trail we insisted on paying by credit card. We were told that if we paid cash we could do it at this desk. If we insisted on paying by card we would have to go back through Security, buy another visa (as we had technically left the country) and pay at the Kenya Airways desk on the concourse. When my partner eventually got to the Kenya Airways concourse desk the staff again insisted he pay in cash. When he refused they suggested they would void the reserved Business Class seats. He continued to insist on paying by card. At this point the price for the upgrade mysteriously dropped from $US210 to $US184 per person. Our conclusion was that the relevant Kenya Airways staff had intended to take the additional $US52 as a “commission “. By the way, my partner did not need to buy a new visa to get back through Security. And we discovered on the flight that our upgrade to Business Class entitled us to the grand total of a glass of water and a wet towel!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fredbloggs456,Bren White wrote a review Oct 2019,Bren White,,5 contributions,2 helpful votes,Nairobi - Kilimanjaro National Park,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r718710166-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Be careful with Kenya Airways staff in Nairobi,Date of travel: July 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I flew business class to Nairobi with Kenyan airways before then jumping on to Kilimanjaro.

I was surprised at the cost (cheaper than expected) so was unsure what to expect. I’m fact I was surprised. There was plenty my of room and the food and service were good. The seats/bed were comfortable. I recommend sitting in isle 2 or 3 they are the quietest. It’s a 2-2-2 configuration. My only comment would be that the entertainment isn’t up with a lot of airlines.

"It has taken me a long time to review my first-time experience flying Kenya Airways, but here goes nothing.
Being a direct flight from New York to Nairobi, Kenya it is hassle-free. My little boy and I had a very interesting flight. The crew was friendly and helpful all through. Despite the long hours (13hrs), we enjoyed our flight.
The service was okay, the seats were small, but I guess one's comfort will cost more. The entertainment was just ok nothing out of the ordinary. The kid's entertainment section was limited. If I was to make a suggestion, I would request that KQ would broaden their entertainment package or better still have WiFi available.

"I was booked on Kenya airways when I used last-minute.com to book my flights to Nairobi. The first 2 legs were via air France then the final leg to Nairobi was Kenya airways. The flight from Amsterdam to Nairobi was on time thankfully but the plane, considering it's not that old, was tired and dated. The service wasn't great. You won't receive the offer of a drink unless it's meal time and no snacks are provided. The food wasn't great, beef or chicken curry with rice for the hot meal and a stale croissant and piece of cake for breakfast. If you ask for water you'll only be given a cup not a bottle. The onboard entertainment is ok with some newer films but not many. The plane seats are pretty hard, not great for long haul.
My return flight from Nairobi to Paris was due to leave at 11:40pm (most international flights seem to leave late at night). This meant I had 11 hours to kill in Nairobi as my flight from Malindi landed around 1pm. I had already checked in so wanted to drop my bags. The desk was reluctant at first to allow this. They said if I dropped my bags I wouldn't be allowed to leave the airport but also it wouldn't be safe to take my luggage around Nairobi. I asked to speak to someone else as it seemed silly that bag drop was open but it meant I was then stuck in the airport. Eventually they agreed I could drop my bags and exit as it was such a long wait. (If anyone else has a long layover I recommend the giraffe centre and carnivore restaurant. We hired a driver called Daniel for a reasonable price to take us round and wait for us and also store bags of our 2 friends who flew with BA and couldn't drop their bags.)
We returned to the airport around 9pm and went straight to our gate. We were due to board at 11:05pm, by 11:30pm there still was no plane at our gate. No communication from the staff until another passenger asked. We were told the plane 'was up there somewhere circling'. Eventually an official announcement was made that the flight was delayed an hour. The gate was very hot and stuffy so they allowed passengers to leave if they wished. Our new flight time of 12:40 came and went, again we were only told of the delay way after the time passed. I left to get coffee and as I was queuing they began to board at 1am. I had to run back to the gate. I paid to upgrade to extra leg room on the return leg which made the uncomfortable seating a little more bearable. The lights were dimmed so people began to sleep only to be woken by the attendants bringing round hot meals around 2:30am. Again, no drinks offered outside of 'meal time'. Breakfast was slightly better than the outbound flight, eggs, potato and spinach with a yoghurt and crossiant. However they leave you with your empty trays for far too long, making you very uncomfy and restricted.
The long delay to our flight meant our 2hr 30 layover in Paris was reduced to 15 mins. Upon landing I mentioned to the crew I needed to disembark quickly and could any ground staff help getting us to our connection. This was just met with a shrug.
Overall I would avoid flying with Kenya airways again. They aren't much cheaper in comparison with much better airlines and improvement is required.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danstar858,danstar858 wrote a review Oct 2019,danstar858,"Manchester, United Kingdom",29 contributions,7 helpful votes,Amsterdam - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r717974815-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Room for improvement,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We booked coach class and then bid a rather absurd amount of money to upgrade the leg from JFK to Nairobi. KQ set the minimum bid at around $1,150pp, we bid the minimum amount, and we “won.”

$2,400 later, we wouldn’t do it again (we actually flew Coach on the way back). Yes, business class is nicer and more comfortable than coach, but it’s not worth that kind of money, especially in the highly likely event that the coach cabin isn’t full.

This isn’t the business/first class treatment you see in the movies and magazines. Chairs are bigger and more comfortable than coach and they basically lie flat, although they’re hardly as good as a bed and at 6 feet tall I had to lie at an angle to keep my feet from pressing against the wall.

The dining trays and monitors are on very cumbersome hinges. it takes some oomph just to get them properly opened and positioned. The biggest problem with the chairs is that they eat phones!! My wife’s phone slid into the cushions and a couple of attendants had to take a goodly part of the chair apart to retrieve. We felt very awkward about causing the difficulty, but then it happened to two other people during our flight!!

Food was fine but again, pretty meh for business class. Movie options ranged from dates to obscure. Service was fine but English proficiency seemed a bit lacking.

I would actually rate the coach class experience better because at least there you get what you pay for. It really wasn’t terrible for a 13hr flight. And I give high marks for KQ opening this direct route from New York to Nairobi. It’s by far the best way to get from the states to central Africa.

But yeah, I wish I hadn’t paid that $2,400 for business class. Not worth it. But if you’ve got the money or the points to waste, by all means enjoy!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/77/ae/default-avatar-2020-2.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bmirak,Brad M wrote a review Oct 2019,Brad M,"Wichita, Kansas",465 contributions,12 helpful votes,New York City - Nairobi,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r717386894-Kenya_Airways-World.html,"Average Quality, But Convenient Route",Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"In September 2019, several passengers, myself included, were asked to wait at the side as there seemed to be an issue with the boarding passes.
We were informed that there were no more seats on the plane we had booked! We were informed that the next flight would be at 11pm that evening and we would be taken to a hotel and brought back to board that plane. No explanation was provided as to why we were not allowed to board by any staff members and no apologies were given.
The 11pm flight was delayed due to ""technical issues"" all passengers were able to see engineers trying to do a patch work job on the plane from the boarding gate area above.
After the plane was ""fixed"" we boarded the plane, after 12:15am. 30 - 45 mins into the flight, the captain announced that the plane was going back to Nairobi, because there was an issue with the plane, and it was unsafe to fly. Essentially the airline let the plane take off knowing it was unsafe, effectively endangering the lives of everyone on-board.
Once again, we were checked into a hotel overnight, were we were told that passengers had to share a room between two people. As a young woman traveling on my own, I refused to share a room with a stranger.

"I took KQ from JHB to Mombasa. This was my second time using the airline and was happy that services have improved though there is still some work to be done. The flights were on time which was quite impressive. The flight attendants were friendly and the food served was OK. I was impressed by the pilots who flew close to Mt Kilimanjaro just to allow the passengers the great view!

The main problem with Kenyan airways is how bad they handle luggage. Both times i have used the airline, my luggage was delayed. The first time, I only managed to get my luggage after about 4 days. This time around, I checked my luggage from Johannesburg well on time but the luggage was not loaded and therefore didn't make it with the flight.

"Kigali to Dubai over Nairobi 5th October 2019 E190 and B787-800 aircrafts. All on time. Check in smooth online where I was notified by KQ 36 hours prior to kick-off. In airport things went well. Granted access to Rwandairs’ Dream Lounge as the usual Business Lounge is under renovation. On the first flight business class was full and people were cramped in 1 x 2 configuration. For solo travellers its important to select the single seats on the left (column A). Welcome champagne given provided the passengers request it, otherwise it is not offered. They had two food options (veg. or chicken) which both were ridiculous, loaded from Nairobi: 1 toothpick of chicken or vegs with a grinded potato cake, total some 50 grams served on a disgusting. Seats are classic Business class with limited reline. Can not justify the high price tag for business class on short flights. In Nairobi I used the wonderful Pride Lounge to catch up with Premier League. The longer leg NBO-DXB was much nicer and a true business class experience. I had two hot kinds of hot meals and they were both acceptable (fish and steak). Staff well rested and In a sparkling mood. IFE fine. Roomy lie flat beds. Food is deteriorating, really bad and poor compared to earlier years of glory. No quality beers and only 1 or 2 wines offered. And the 2 beer brands they offer are just industrialised mass products of low quality. However, I rate KQ fairly high due to their good lounges, good flights on widebody aircrafts, nice FAs, and ability to handle irregularities.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/0c/0f/6a/385andersp.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/385andersp,385andersp wrote a review Oct 2019,385andersp,"Hue, Vietnam",36 contributions,44 helpful votes,Kigali - Dubai,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r715590041-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Busgating in Nairobi,Date of travel: October 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Following our first flight from Zanzibar to Nairobi we boarded our flight to Amsterdam on this Dreamliner.

Our expectations were low for this airline given that we were supposed to fly Qatar and Emirates for our trip to Tanzania.  We were totally surprised at  how great the flight was.   First off we sat in the front section of business class in the middle seats.  The cabin was very spread out with more legroom than I anticipated. Meals were fine-nothing extraordinary but quick service  which let us  get the sleep that we wanted.  Sleep experience was perfect.  Crew was great.  Pillow and cover was fine.   Weakest part was the movie selection and the amenity kit.  Flights were on time and i would definitely recommend this non stop flight to Kenya with then  a  short flight Kilimanjaro.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/10/05/0d/75/whenzuc.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whenzuc,whenzuc wrote a review Oct 2019,whenzuc,"Long Island, New York",905 contributions,360 helpful votes,New York City - Nairobi,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r715034444-Kenya_Airways-World.html,great flight non stop New York to Kenya,Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Kenya Airways is absolute garbage and I don't know how they are still in business.  What a ripoff!  I paid for business class roundtrip, my return flight was delayed until 2:30 am and then cancelled, I was stranded for one night in Nairobi and then another night in New York, and then they NEVER ACTUALLY BOOKED MY CONNECTING FLIGHT SO I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A TICKET HOME!!!  Yet they swore the entire time that I had a ticket.  I have tried for a month to get a refund and they won't respond.  The customer service is routed through a call center in India that is absolutely worthless.  I tried calling their home office in Nairobi (no toll free number so incurred international charges) and got hung up on before anyone could help me.  Twice.  Emails are ignored.  I am by far not the only one having these problems, either.  BELIEVE ME, THE NON-STOP FROM JFK TO NBO IS NOT WORTH THIS!!!

"Firstly, they left my bag in Dubai in 2015 and delayed 5 days out of my precious holidays before I got it back. My holidays was for 2 weeks. All the perishables in my got expired, and i got no compensation for that. I swore never to fly with them again.

few months ago, I wanted to book Ethiopian airline, and the app booked Kenya airways by accident. I was upset and contacted Tajwal. They told me that the refund would take 2 weeks, but I have only 2 days. So, i decided to take the risk of flying with them and not ask for a refund.

that flight had 18 hours layover, there was no single support or provision for accommodation from this airline. I and others were in the cold airport for 18 hours waiting for the whole day for my connecting flight.

When i got to Dubai, i decided to change the date of the flight and they told me to pay 753 USD for change of date for a ONE-WAY trip, which was part of the first trip during which i had a very terrible experience. Meanwhile, for the same dates that i selected, Emirate Airline charges 660 for a ROUND TRIP. When i asked for the reason for the ridiculous cost, the rude customer care attendant, Sylvia told me that it the difference from my original booking. And i was furious. Trying to find a way to sort this out, Ms Sylvia hung up on me/ disconnected the chat and probably blocked me because I can't connect with them anymore. i printed the conversation out. Feel free to request for it, and I will send to you.

Even if Kenya Airways is the only Airline that can fly to where my life will be saved, i will rather travel by sea.

When you decide to patronise your own people, they treat you like sh""t.

"We took two trips on this airline in order to get from Nairobi to Cape Town (via Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe). One flight was definitely better than the other. Here's why:
Nairobi-Vic Falls...Terrible check-in process with not enough desks open for the number of people waiting; plane delayed for nearly 5 hours with zero communication to passengers; pathetic option for people to obtain 'breakfast' via a voucher from the airline at one of the in-airport cafes - a boiled egg and a cup of tea.
Vic Falls-Cape Town...easy check-in at Vic Falls; clean and comfortable plane; good food; pleasant staff.
Better consistency in communication and care for passengers required in general.

"My wife and I have flown extensively around the world, including internal flights on 'smaller' airlines but this was the worst overall experience of flying by far.
Online Check in was a waste of time - even though we had pre selected seats, with a minute gone of our scheduled check in time all seats were full and only paid for seats were left available.
Upon arrival at the bag drop we we were told our seats had changed (small children needing hanging cots), so we had wasted our time booking seats
During the flight, unless you literally stand in the way of the trolley you will not get a drink - they fly past you and when we asked for a soft drink as they had missed us, they said they had run out.
We were on a dreamliner which I am sure had been used for dirt collecting courses as it was filthy - my seat was broken (didn't recline) and the plane seemed old and tatty even though it was fairly new.
Staff are totally uninterested in you and the food is terrible -
offered beef or chicken, so i asked what is the dish? I was told beef or chicken, so i asked again and was given chicken with no explanation of what it was. It was terrible.
Our return flight was no better - dirty plane, broken seat, uninterested staff and again we had to pay to reserve seats we had already selected. Food was even worse and I basically had to go and ask for soft drinks as the trolley was whisked past In a blur.
The only positives were the flights were all on time and inflight entertainment is good - not many new titles but good.
In summary, I would not fly with Kenya Airways again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/5a/default-avatar-2020-36.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wisteria55,Deano55 wrote a review Sep 2019,Deano55,"Colchester, United Kingdom",13 contributions,,London - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r713562453-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Appalling,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I booked months ago and had a flight out around 7 PM (Seychelles to Nairobi) and then a flight the next morning to Livingstone.  I had booked a hotel in Nairobi.   Kenya Airways inexplicably changed the flight schedule so KQ259 departs at 3:15 AM!!   I unfortunately learned this reflects their complete disregard for the human beings who are their passengers.I was able to cancel my hotel but had to kill 9 hours at the small Seychelles airport, and then right as we were ready to board, they announced the flight was cancelled.  According to some airport personnel, Kenya Airways frequently does this.  This meant I could not get to Livingstone, where I was booked that night at an expensive resort (prepaid and non-refundable).Kenya Airways issued vouchers but sent us to a horrible hotel that was very old and smelled badly.   The very nice service manager in Seychelles said he had contacted Nairobi and they'd be all prepared for me (there were other problems, like needing a visa and vouchers because of another overnight stay caused by their cancellation, and them having trouble honouring an exit row I had prepaid for).  However, NO ONE in Nairobi knew what was going on.  I was shuffled from person to person and desk to desk.  I wound up spending over 2 hours trying to leave the airport and finally left around 10 PM.  The bus drove over 30 minutes, past dozens of airport hotels, to another horrible property that feels really unsafe (there is LOTS of security!).   Obviously, Kenya Airways makes deals with these second rate properties so they don't have to send their passengers to decent properties.   Meantime, I got here at 10:10, and they are picking me up to return to the airport at 4 AM.All up, this means over 48 hours of no sleep because of Kenya Airways cancellation and subsequent disorganization and disregard.  Sleep deprivation makes everything difficult, and Kenya Aiways has single handedly compromised my long-planned holidayI see there are other travelers with similar, or much worse, experiences, so I don't think mine was an unusual experience.  Don't let this airline ruin your holiday - it will be well worth the money to pay extra to avoid Kenya Airways",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/10/40/97/8f/drbobqa.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrBobQA,DrBobQA wrote a review Sep 2019,DrBobQA,"Queensland, Australia",43 contributions,41 helpful votes,Victoria - Livingstone,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r713451977-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Nightmare!!

"My wife and I spent months planning our anniversary trip to Africa. We thought we were so lucky that there was a non-stop flight from NYC area to Nairobi, Kenya. We went ahead and booked on Kenya Airways. As we go closer to our departure date we were offered to bid on upgrading to Business Class Cabin, for a significant fee. We had just received a new credit card that had no interest for 18 months so we decided that we would splurge on ourselves and bid to upgrade and get the chance to be a little pampered and arrive rested in Kenya. Things were good when we were seated. The cabin crew was amazing! I place no fault on them for any of this. You see, as it turned out, both our entertainment systems were malfunctioning which made using them an inconvenience. On a 14hr flight it's a big deal to have distractions and not having the system functioning properly made the trip feel even longer. And we paid a LOT of money to get premium service. So I complained to Kenya Airways directly and let them know how disappointed I was. They could care less. No offers to make it right like maybe passes to the airport lounge for our return flight, or some discount on something in the future. They just don't care and don't feel they need to make it right. I feel ripped off and if we ever do get to visit that beautiful country again it certainly won't be on this airline.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/95/avatar021.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DGVNJ,DGVNJ wrote a review Sep 2019,DGVNJ,"Elmwood Park, New Jersey",145 contributions,169 helpful votes,New York City - Nairobi,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r712922976-Kenya_Airways-World.html,"NEVER upgrade to Business, you will get ripped off.",Date of travel: August 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Perfect Airline! 4 times flying and always great!

Dont compare Kenya Airways to the luxury airlines like Emirates etc. regarding bord entertainment (although it was definetely sufficient on the ling flight, just bring your own if you want to watch or hear special stuff), seats,  etc. as they do not have A380s. But the food we got was for me surprisingly good and on the flight from Ams to Nairobi we had the Boeing Dreamliner.

The food was edible, but the usual aircraft fare. In a restaurant you would send it back, on an airplane, you eat it!

"I was excited to hear there was a non-stop from New York to Nairobi, which cuts down my travel time a lot. I expected this to be a top-notch pull-out-all-the-stops kind of flight, but - well - it wasn't really. All the basis were there (lie-flat seat, for example), but most not very high quality.
Starting with check-in: there wasn't any capacity to get my boarding-pass marked with TSA pre-check (apparently because new to JFK), and they weren't even sure that my business-class ticket would get me in a shorter line. It did, but not much shorter!
The lounge we use is 15 minutes' walk to the gate.
No separate line for boarding business-class passengers.
When I got on, it was hard to find someone to take my jacket.
There was (as said) a lie-flat seat, but the controls were hard to make work, and hard to get the - tiny - screen out.
The amenity kit was small, no slippers.
Staff varied - great chief steward, reluctant and apparently resentful other staff.
Small - though quite interesting - movie collection. Mostly small-budget films.
OK meals (help me not to put on weight), but no espresso.

"We flew to and from New York to Nairobi with Kenya Airways and in my opinion, the company has much to improve on from the customer's point of view.
Starting in New York, we arrived at the terminal 3 hours early. Our boarding pass only indicated the terminal and not the gate. So, we sat in terminal 4 waiting for the screens and the online flight trackers to show the gate number. As the flight departure got closer, the gate number still never showed up in the screens or online. As a result, we almost missed our flight. The only way found out was that the gate agent called my cellphone to inform me that the doors were about to close and to run to the gate as fast as we can. When I told the gate agent about the lack of information, they didn't seem to care.
The food inflight was mediocre to poor quality. If you want to eat something decent, order the vegan option which is fruit. That seemed to be the only good meal option.
The bathrooms got dirty mid flight. One had water all over the floor. A couple of them had ran out of soap and toilet paper.

We arrived early to check in at the desk for our return flight because they wouldn't let us check in online only to be told to wait until 6pm to check in. We returned to the desk at 6pm as told but we were told to go somewhere else as the check in was still not open. At 6:30, someone finally came to the check in desk, but we had to still wait longer as the travel document checker was still not there.
At check in, the agent told us that the boarding time was 2 hours before departure due to additional security measures (after the main secuirty). Of course, the secondary security agents were also 45 minutes late and after we passed through this security checkpoint, we had to wait another hour or so to board to plane.
You could have guessed this already, but the flight also departed 30+ minutes late.
At arrival in New York, after they opened the cabin door, a cabin crew member commanded everyone to return to their seats and put their luggage away without explanation. We were to wait around again.
The only positive thing I can say about Kenya Airways is that they have non-stop flights between JFK and Nairobi, but I might choose another airline if Kenya Airways stays as disorganized and as poor in their customer service skills.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/ba/3f/ae/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seeeyes,Dani wrote a review Sep 2019,Dani,"Spring Lake, New Jersey",42 contributions,10 helpful votes,New York City - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r710885855-Kenya_Airways-World.html,An airline with poor customer service and organization,Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Early morning at Nairobi’s Terminal 1A wasn’t too crowded although try to avoid the first two of several security x-ray lanes once you’ve ascended to the first floor after Immigration for there is no dedicated Airline Crew Lane and crew will walk to the front of the passenger queues and jump in.  That means a lot of crew members at busy times and passengers have to wait.Boarding the 787 was strictly by seat row numbers which really made the boarding process a breeze and the fully laden aircraft was ready to leave ahead of schedule.  Following take-off, a breakfast snack was served: a choice of chicken or vegetarian (small) pastie and a small cake with hot/cold/alcoholic drinks (seated at the rear and receiving all food/drink services last, I was unsure whether passengers at the front had a third choice – usually KQ offer that).  A hot dinner (choice of chicken or vegetarian Bake) was served 3 hours before arrival and, again, not sure if a 3rd choice was initially available.  Just two drink rounds during the 8-hour flight although drinks could be collected from the rear galley throughout.  I’d describe KQs food as basic and bland although I took my own food on board as I know what this airline's offering can be like.With the exception of one uncommunicative and unhappy looking individual whose name badge announced ‘Sylvia’, the all-female Cabin Crew were cheerful and appeared to enjoy their work.  Little information came from the Flight Deck.An on-time arrival into Amsterdam on to a very convenient ‘E’ Gate next to the Terminal hub with a wide range of comfortable facilities and friendly staff.  AMS is one of the best transit airports in Europe.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/10/fa/3d/80/simbal09.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Simbal09,Simbal09 wrote a review Sep 2019,Simbal09,"London, United Kingdom",160 contributions,109 helpful votes,Nairobi - Amsterdam,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r710832980-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Satisfactory,Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My flight from Dubai to Nairobi was delayed by 2 hours on Sunday morning. I missed my connecting flight to Johannesburg. I should have been in Johannesburg by 16:30 on Sunday. The next suitable flight was only on Monday at 7:45 AM. I stayed at a hotel but when I got to the airport in Nairobi on Monday morning I was told the 7:45 flight was cancelled. I would have to wait till 13:15 to catch the next flight to Johannesburg. Nairobi airport is ugly, crowded and an unpleasant place for a 7 hour wait. I got to Johannesburg 24 hours after I was supposed to be there. 36 hours in transit is not fun. It was supposed to be a 12 hour journey.

Many flights were cancelled on Monday morning in Nairobi. There were many angry people around waiting and waiting to catch the next flight. I heard and read in the news that Kenya airways have lost numerous pilots to middle eastern airlines. They cancel flights because they don’t have enough pilots to fly them. Their pilots are reported to be unhappy.

I am supposed to fly back to Dubai on Kenya Airways.

Once I got there told the flight was delayed again. No organisation. When boarding eventually took place, it was chaotic and potentially dangerous.

"Kenya Airways is the national carrier for the East African country, operating out of the hub in Nairobi.  It flies to several countries in Africa as well as a range of destinations further afield.  It is not a great flight experience which would be ok if the price wasn't so high.The positives around Kenya Airways are the quick check-in.  The dedicated terminal in Nairobi for instance is incredibly quick with hardly any queues mid-morning on a weekday.  It is really easy to get around the small terminal although there is not a huge amount to do there.The on-board experience is ok but not quite as friendly as anticipated.  After being encouraged to take up an emergency exit seat given the need fo the row to be populated there was not really any friendly communication afterwards once the staff had got what they wanted.  Seating is uncomfortable.  The lining of the seat does not make for a great experience for a 3+ hour flight.  The fabric is not tight against the seat structure so creates slight friction.  The design is ugly in any case.  Legroom was ok with enough space for a normal-sized person in either a typical row or emergency exit row.The in-flight experience is minimal.  Food is included and on request a pre-ordered dietary requirement meal was grudgingly provided.  It was not great.  The food was pretty ropey to be honest.  Entertainment selection is limited.  There are not many options.  The television options were largely extremely dull lowest common denominator American comedies while the film selection to its credit did include 1 or 2 classics along with a small range of contemporary Hollywood, Bollywood, and a couple of other options.All the limitations would be fine if this was a moderate cost flight but it is really quite expensive.  A return flight Kinshasa-Nairobi is not cheap in the slightest and so at the price the quality is not good enough.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/04/a0/62/7a/malarchy.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Malarchy,Malarchy wrote a review Sep 2019,Malarchy,"Vienna, Austria",844 contributions,609 helpful votes,Kinshasa - Nairobi,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r709840306-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Expensive but moderate quality,Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The flight from Nairobi to Cape Town via Livingstone was ordinary. The business class seats did not fully recline, there was no inflight entertainment system and the food was just okay.

With the stop over the flight is almost five to six hours and the business class seats should be more comfortable. On return, as Platinum members, we took economy class seats and had the first row (no. 11) allocated to us. Ironically we found these seats more comfortable because there was no middle seat passenger.

The aircraft was also a little old and needs refurbishment.

Have taken three flights on Kenya Airways in the past six weeks and the Nairobi to Cape Town flight was probably the worst.

"Unfortunately we got off to a bad start with Kenyan Airways as our flight out to Zanzibar, via Nairobi was delayed by 12 hours, with no real reason as to why. The airline did put us up in a nice hotel but unfortunately this meant we lost an entire day of our holiday! We of course missed our connecting flight and was thus scheduled on another one that gave us a lay over of more than 8 hours in Kenya Airport with 2 kids! This was just dismal as there is not much to do in the airport and the food etc. is very expensive. We made it through our time in the airport, JUST, with two changes to boarding passes as they changed the flight we were supposed to be on TWICE! We eventually left again after midnight for our flight to Zanzibar, now going via Dar e Salaam, another change in schedule! We landed in Dar after 2am, to wait 2 hours on the plane for one passenger to arrive to fly the 15 MINUTES to Zanzibar!! We finally got to our destination over 36 hours later than expected!! No apology or much explanation!!
Luckily our flights home went smoothly and we arrived ON TIME after 3 pleasant flights!
Unfortunately we hear now that Kenyan Airways is renowned for being late or cancelling flights!!

"Worst experience in many years of travel. No priority line at check-in. Delayed flight 4 hours at check-in, made no accommodation to go ahead to rebook my transfer even on their own commuter.  I had to travel without knowing if I would be booked to final destination or when creating confusion and inconvenience for my pickup. No communication at gate for when flight would depart.( or if it may be cancelled) and the plane was at least 25 years old. Kenya business class service is more like basic economy on other airlines from 29 years ago.  Food was despicable. Who serves dinner at 1 am? Cold and tasted rubbery. On arrival it took 15 minutes to get  the stairs up to the plane. Workers had the stairs against the plane door so it would not open.That should have been obvious. Once in Nairobi had to argue with desk agent to get connection booked. And then had another 8 hours layover. My Visit to business lounge, I was questioned as to my validity to use this facility even with business class ticket. Once in lounge this food was also cold and limited. Not the standard experienced from other airline lounges. Never saw an employee smile anywhere on Kenya and never felt appreciated or even remotely welcomed. Lounge had dirty toilets. Needless to say.

"Kenya Airways reminds me of flying in the 1960's or 70's.  They made a schedule change that we found out about on the flight and added a stop in Dar es Salaam which meant that our flight got in at 4:20 AM instead of 2:20 AM.  I almost got off in Dar because of their announcements.  Unfortunately, they are the only way to get to where I needed to be.  Two weeks later, my flight back was delayed almost 3 hours for no announced reason and I had to get my KLM tickets updated in Nairobi which was several long walks for no apparent reason.

"Early boarding at Amsterdam for the full Kenyan Airways 788 to Nairobi gave us an on-time departure for a flight which ended with an on-time arrival in Kenya.  Informative commentaries by the First Officer in Kiswahili and English were supported by further announcements from the Cabin Purser albeit that the low volume from the Purser allowed few passengers to hear what was said.  Although service from the all-female African Cabin Crew, smartly attired in their smart crimson blouses and bright red trouser suits was satisfactory, they gave the distinct impression that they had to do the job rather wanted to do it!  At times, it was relatively lackadaisical although this may have partly reflected their culture rather than their motivation.  A basic, sufficient and tasty meal with Beef, Chicken and Vegetarian choices was served after take-off with hot/cold/alcoholic drinks although some seated at the rear of the aircraft were denied this full choice since service always commenced at the front and meals were slowly depleted as the crew moved rearwards.  Water rounds continued during the 7½ flight every 30 minutes and a small snack with hot/cold drinks was served an hour before landing.  Despite the 32” pitch and 18.5” wide seats, I was not entirely comfortable and room for manoeuvring was limited in the full cabin.  Kenyan Airways has the scrap line ‘The Pride of Africa’: this is erroneous for the airline service that I experienced certainly wasn’t although I had no complaints and would consider flying with the company again if the price matched other airlines.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/10/fa/3d/80/simbal09.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Simbal09,Simbal09 wrote a review Sep 2019,Simbal09,"London, United Kingdom",160 contributions,109 helpful votes,Amsterdam - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r709035649-Kenya_Airways-World.html,As Good As Most,Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My daughter and I were so excited to take our first direct flight from Africa to America. I didn’t know what to expect, but was very happy with the service. There was a lot of excitement as most of the customers seemed equally thrilled to be on a direct flight from east Africa to the ‘Big Apple’. The service was good and the food was decent, although they should improve by adding some snacks as this is a very long flight.  It would be nice to have some potato chips, candy bars and trail mix throughout.   I would also recommend that they increase the water service, as it is a long fight and people need to stay hydrated.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/7e/4a/90/barbara-m.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarbM303,Barb M wrote a review Sep 2019,Barb M,"Orlando, Florida",209 contributions,68 helpful votes,Nairobi - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r708364261-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Fastest Way to NYC,Date of travel: August 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I used my miles to get to from RNO to JFK. Then took a non stop from JFK to NBO. What a great flight. 14 hours, yes it i long, but it is so much better then flying through Europe. I go to Kenya 1-2 a year. Kenya Air just startnig flying this route. Good prices, wonderful services and convenience is the major attraction.
Typically from the US you must go through Europe. You arrive in the morning and have to wait 6-12 hours for the overnight connection flight to Kenya. No enough time to get out of the airport and the very longest connection time you will experince especially after an overnight flight from the US.
On kenya Air- you leave at noon and arrive 14 hours later. A few movies, a book, couple great meals and a drink - you are there.
It is the best. Go for it.

"I know it may sound untrue to many frequent flyers but going to Europe from Kenya (or from EU to Kenya), I warmly recommend Kenya Airways.
I am a frequent flyer and use KQ regularly since I first came to Africa, 2005.
Comparing it to other companies (not to name them) that fly that route, KQ staff are definitely nicest.
And very important for me, KQ doesn’t treat the passengers as a cargo that needs uninterrupted cold chain. I mean, other companies just put their air conditioners on absolute minimum. Almost freezing. I always end up with sinusitis or cold.

"I lost my suitcases with Kenya airways when I was going to my country in Mai 2019. I came back to dubai on June to follow up my complains that I used to send to them by email from Cmeroon. Mr: Kazungu from Nairobi has sent me the compensation form of 4000 aed which is nothing comparing with what I lost. I just accepted that amount so that I will be able to give them to my husband paid everything for our family.
As I am writing this review now, we did not yet receive that compensation of 4000 ead.
Mr: Kazungu stopped replying to our emails. Can you imagine what I feel about this company. You lost your luggages you start complaining since Mai up to date and they don't care. They are ignoring my emails even to reply no.
This company has no feeling about customer, they don't care at all. I went to their office in dubai, the customers service on the grand floor are very rude with poeple. It's like as if you are in the prison and you have no right to say anythink to them.
Very bad experience with this company, promis you guys that I will never forget the way you are traiting us. I am shocked with this kind of service.

"Wanted to try Kenya Airways on the BKK-CAN route, unfortunately the outbound flight was delayed 6 hours.
KA staff were very good in advising the delay 24 hours ahead and accomodating my request to be switched to Thai Airways as my travel plans were not flexible enough to have a 2am morning arrival in Guangzhou. Well done on this Customer Service.

The return CAN-BKK flight was on schedule but I was disappointed with the poor level of check-in staff service. And why does KA not label Priority baggage with a separate tag? On arrival in BKK it took some time for my bag to arrive mixed in with general luggage.

Once checked in there was the usual comedy to get airside but T2 at CAN is modern and has decent shopping and club facilities.

Flight boarded on time, the crew were BKK based as this flight is a turnaround and were friendly and efficient. However, the food service offered was dismal, (see photo of inedible pastry pie), and the wine glasses are so small that when half filled you barely get three sips before empty.

For the 3 hour flight this is a good service between Bangkok and Guangzhou with reasonable pricing but with only one flight a day does risk delays. The 787 service is better than the China Southern 737 service but Thai Airways A350 service is over the horizon better.

Regret KA to meet expectations and for long haul the 2-2-2 in Business is outdated.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/24/1d/ab/4d/rockpanel.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rockpanel,Rockpanel wrote a review Sep 2019,Rockpanel,"Florence, Kentucky",62 contributions,52 helpful votes,Guangzhou - Bangkok,Southeast Asia,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r707112536-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Decent Business service between on the Bangkok to Guangzhou route,Date of travel: September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"There are some very good things about Kenya Airways, and some not so great. When we booked our trip for 5 of us, Kenya airways had the best schedule and price. The way there was great. Everything went smoothly. The plane was very quiet, and the inflight entertainment was perfect - lots of movies to choose from. The food was just okay. But, we arrived to our destination safely, and our luggage was waiting for us which was a relief! For some reason our seats on the return flight (just a couple of rows in front of our first trip), were torturous! My husband and I were both very uncomfortable and ended up using our neck pillows as seat cushions. Only 3 of our 6 bags were at the airport when we landed back in JFK. We had to wait one week for them to arrive. It was certainly a hassle following up daily, but we were thankful that it happened on the way home and not the way there.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bestfamilytime,Amanda F wrote a review Sep 2019,Amanda F,"Boston, Massachusetts",4 contributions,,New York City - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r705763110-Kenya_Airways-World.html,JFK to NBO for 5 people,Date of travel: July 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We flew from JFK to Nairobi on August 15 in Business Class. It was the worst flight I have taken in years.
First our seats were broken, no lights, no call buttons, no entertainment service, no power. They did lie flat, but that is all they did. Since the flight was full there was no place to move to.
There was no option for either meal, by the time they got to us(there are only 30 business class seats), there were no options for dinner or breakfast, just what they had. They gave my wife a crew meal, since they only offered fish for dinner. She is allergic to fish.
When I asked to charge my device, my request was ignored.
I emailed the airline on arrival and they offered to make things right. The didn’t.
We asked for seats in row 2, we got row 3 by the toilets, so the aroma of chemical toilets filled our flight home. The airline tried to push an Asian vegetarian meal on us on the way home. It took 5 emails to fix this.
The service on our flight home was impeccable. Further showing how horrible the flight out was.
The seats worked on the way home, but the headsets did not and there were no spares.
Business class that was terrible, who knew it could exist?
We found it and they frustrated us beyond belief rather than fix it.
Avoid this airline, it is failing and we found out why first hand.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/royc506,Roy C wrote a review Sep 2019,Roy C,"Melville, New York",40 contributions,34 helpful votes,New York City - Nairobi,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r705434497-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Avoid at all cost,Date of travel: August 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We booked our reservation through Kenya Airlines directly for our safari.  Previously we booked through KLM, which was very good.  Recently we received notification that one leg of our flights was cancelled and Kenya Air suggested an alternate flight. But the layovers did not work. Only left 30 min to catch international flight at JFK.  I opened an online Chat with an agent. The Kenya Airways agent said they could not help as it was an American flight that was disrupted. She didn't know that I had already spoken with American; and they said they had no record of our reservation (true). The agent with Kenya Airways did NOTHING to try and help me, via chat, she was online with me but did not respond to any of my inquiries once she said that she could not help - even though we booked through them originally!

the flight is always onetime as I have come to appreciate, and that's one thing that really helps with planning.

the only downside is the fact that they serve only pastries with a drink. previously there was a choice of a meal which had a pastry attached as desert, but without warning, that was scrapped.

"When I first became aware of Kenya Airways I thought to myself another small airline in Africa, but I had to swollow these words after my interaction with them.

My travel agent booked me a trip to Zanzibar & I just said go ahead with it.

On getting the tickets I saw I was booked on Kenya Airways, nearly had a light seisure.

Being the optimist I am I went ahead with the arrangement.

As I boarded my first flight on Kenya Airways, heading for Zanzibar. I was suitably impressed by the staff's attention to detail & utter professionalism.

They were curtious & extremely friendly and nothing was to much for them.

I must say my perception of this airline has changed dramatically as I had more interaction with them, they just made me feel relaxed as if I've used them for ages.

To the management and staff thank you so much for a great experience, keep up the excellent service & food served on all my flights.

In my eyes they brought customer service to new heights and now I understand their motto & extremely deserved one ""The Pride of Africa""

"In the past I've enjoyed Kenya Airways' flights, so I was looking forward to this.

My first flight - Harare to Nairobi, was pleasantly early departing and landing - food meagre in quantity, but tasty, white wine very pleasant, in flight entertainment adequate, but poor range of films (recent films - only two). Staff were very good and very friendly. Top marks here.

Second flight - Nairobi to Dubai - was an hour late arriving and taking off and landing (""operational reasons"") and KA staff at the Nairobi terminal were surly and unhelpful. Once airborne, food was once again meagre in quantity but tasty, white wine again was nice, in flight entertainment however was non existent (no screens in seats, and dropdown screens in ceilings every three rows were not operational) - for a six hour flight this was a bit of a pain. Flight staff were fine apart from one stewardess who was clearly tired and snappy.

So in a nutshell I think KA is suffering a bit from lack of cash. I'd happily use them again (and will do) but hope they get the funds to raise their game a bit, because they've deteriorated a little since I was last flying with them.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0a/3e/ee/3c/shaggyd0g1.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaggyd0g1,shaggyd0g1 wrote a review Aug 2019,shaggyd0g1,"Glencoe, United Kingdom",423 contributions,213 helpful votes,Harare - Dubai,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r699979421-Kenya_Airways-World.html,"Two flights, one early, one late.

"I need to report the misconduct and mistreatment that I received in transit counter by staff on Sunday June 30, 2019 who was on duty from 4:30 afterwards. My connection flight was from KIA to Addis Ababa and the ticket that I received shows 7 hours waiting hours in JKIA until midnight. I approached to the counter to request weather I can get an accommodation for this waiting period since the flight is rescheduled while I was flying from KIA Tanzania. A gentleman there explained that was not allowed. I asked to the reason why this is not put on the ticket that I print and there is no reason for me to wait for nearly 8 hours in the terminal while they are the one who changed the flight. He send me to  the another madam whom he said is a ""supervisor"" whom I don't think that she is. It is on stage that the aforementioned  colleagues just get into the dialogue where she made it personal and was blaming me for not knowing the terms and conditions. This ticket was bought by my company and was asked to check a name because that is where I get a trouble with oftentimes when I travel. However, even if I was not the one who bought this ticket she personally was attacking me with venom words in front of other passengers as if I did something wrong or take advantage of anything there. Knowing that this things must have been sorted out when the tickets were bought which I realized very late, was asking if there is any other flight before that hours that I may catch. But this colleague was keep intervening on this conversation and keep embarrassing me. They even refused to call a supervisor seeing that she is clearly misbehaving and make a team later on to offend me more.My flight delayed in the first instance and informed very late and on top of that this incident made very upset with your airline service!

Their service was above excellent but coming home we were back with Kenya airlines and the international leg was awful the flight was delayed and we hadnt eaten since 5am the morning thankfully i ate something at the airport...we got on the plane and we only ate 5-6 hours late at lunch...i asked the flight attendant if we will get something to eat (in the kindest manner) and she responded no! Then smirked and said africans are the most hospitable when it comes to food! I was so shocked and appalled at this bad unprofessional behaviour.
The seats were dirty when we got in, the plane wasnt cleaned, i had to ask them to remove the papers and dirt from previous passangers ...it was just an awful experience.

"I booked my holiday trip with this airline for the very first and last time.
While the departure flight from Dubai to Nairobi, delayed by hours with missing connection flight to Vic Falls and communicated 1 day before the flight, was replaced by a flight with a different company, both the return flights have been delayed up to 15 hours with missed connection in Nairobi and no substitution flight.
Communication were poor and the assistance in both Vic Falls and Nairobi was unacceptable. In Vic Falls limited access to the restaurants was given well after that passengers already ate and payed or reached the business lounge at their expenses. In Nairobi, after having been stranded for hours, finally we were given a low-level hotel, under noisy renovation and situated far away from the airport, for the few 3 hours remaining.
I do not know if the extreme slowness in assigning a hotel and a transport was due to just laziness and carelessness or, as it looked apparent from the observed behavior and conversations, the employees at the help-desk have agreements with some hotels managers to minimize the guests stay and maximize the financial return for the hotels.

"I flew on KQ for the first time, but my family has traveled earlier with KQ. On both occasions our experience has been not good.

This time I was on a holiday with my family to Cape Town, South Africa. I found their timings perfect to CPT hence booked on KQ. Journey to CPT was good expect that there is no in-flight entertainment on a flight with more than 5 hours. You have to kill you time somehow. Food was average, can't complain. Legroom very good and spacious. A serious issue was with cabin temperature, It really feels hot inside in-spite of requesting flight attendants it was overlooked. As I mentioned earlier, my family had faced this issue earlier.

My nightmare starts with the return flight on 7th of Aug. Flight delayed by 1 hour 45 min. No information from the airline till we reach CPT airport. So we miss our connecting flight. We were booked for another connecting flight at 6.45 Once I landed in Nairobi, I approached the transit help desk, who informed that we will be given hotel accommodation. We proceed to immigration and complete formalities after 45 minutes. Next we go the the counter where they were providing us hotel vouchers. The time was around 2 am in the morning. To our surprise, the staff informs us that we will be picked up for the flight from the hotel at 3 am. That was not cool. So I got my flight rescheduled for 8.30 am so that I can take some rest. It took us a long wait to get to the shuttle and another 40 minutes to reach the hotel. Imagine all this happening early in the morning after a long flight. The shuttle picked us up at 5 am. Next, I arrive at my destination to find out that my baggage was left behind at Nairobi. Reason, time between connecting flight very less. How much time do you take to transfer a bag from one flight to another? We arrived NBO at 23.30 hrs. More than 8 hours to transfer bags!!

All accepted, what was not appealing was the way things were being handled at the KQ help desks. Staff least bothered and were working at their own pace. Once I had to ask them if we have to sleep at the airport.

It seems flight delays are very common in KQ. This was voiced by many of my friends. The last flight my wife took to travel was delayed as well resulting in missing a non KQ flight. That was a non refundable ticket.

"Kenya Airways is the most affordable way to travel from East Africa to New York, hands down. I've done the direct Nairobi to JFK flight a couple of times now, and I greatly enjoy the flight (large plane - the Dreamliner, good food, good selection of movies, friendly and helpful staff). However, I've also flown quite a bit on Kenya Airways from Kigali to Nairobi and from Nairobi to Mauritius, and these flights are not always as great in terms of service or experience. There are often delays in the flights - a couple of times they have delayed the flight by several hours and sent a message ahead of time, but other times they don't tell you until you are at the airport. This means that I am afraid to have a short layover in Nairobi, and often end up booking a lengthy layover to avoid delays making me miss my connection. Boarding experience in Nairobi could be much better managed as well. If you pay for the extra leg room seats, they have you board in the last group. You may or may not get personal screens on the shorter flights, depending on the plane, but if you do, the selection is very sparse, not like the selection for the 14 hour flight. I'll continue to take Kenya Airways for their direct Nairobi to JFK flight, because the price can't be beat, but for shorter trips I'd prefer other carriers.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/17/25/f2/4e/laurel-s1717.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurel_s1717,laurel_s1717 wrote a review Aug 2019,laurel_s1717,"Kigali, Rwanda",142 contributions,53 helpful votes,Kigali - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r698039670-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Better for longer flights,Date of travel: July 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This was the final leg of my inlaws month long journey to the USA. The trip was their first flight among their many ""firsts"". My concerns on the way to the US was that they made the connection in JFK, I was informed by Delta that they made the connection.
KENYA Air was completely different...On the return sent an initial request after about 30 minutes...no response...sent a second response after 2 hours again no response. My concern was that both in laws were unfamiliar with the airport process...and the second concern was that my Mother in law has limited understanding of English
Very poor show by Kenya Air for such a simple question...""Had they made to flight to Nairobi?""
I personally loved my trip on Kenya Air and the attention they provided, but that was a few years back (2012) My enjoyment/experience was one of the reasons I made this booking via Kenya Airways, might need to rethink it for future bookings.

"I fly extensively around the globe and kenya airways have the worse ground personnel ever!
I usually dont complain much but they are below the average! The shame of africa!
The speed those transfer desk for KQ takes forever. No greetings, no way of addressing their customers. Even though the airline is at fault, not even a “sorry”. They are not just bothered at all. They took me from the flight because of their own mistake. The transfer desk “supervisor” came to talk to me, not even a sorry! They have no idea what hospitality is about!
2 days ago I flew with them, delayed take off by 1hr and when we arrived into Nairobi, their president apparently took our parking slot and we were stuck in the aircraft on ground with door closed for another 40mins. So 1hr40mins delay because of their lack of planning! 3 times I traveled with them and 2 times my luggage never came! One time it came after 24hour and they next time it came after 36hours!

You have to go back to the airport and with all the traffic in Kinshasa, it takes the whole day. Apparently they are doing this game only in the DRC.

"First flight with Kenya and despite the aircraft being a 787, the first impression I have is that it has not been cleaned properly. The edges of the overhead bins are very dirty and leaves a bad first impression. How long would it take to wipe these surfaces? It gives an impression of a lack of care.

Other than that, the flight and service were perfectly acceptable but unexceptional. The entertainment was sufficient but lacked some of the newer movies other airlines might have. My seat on the aisle was fine and I like the 3-3-3 layout.

"Kigali-Bujumbura-Nairobi-Dubai on 31 July 2019 on an old E190 and on a newer B787, respectively. Faultless travels, first flight to NBO via BJM on time, 2nd flight delayed 70 Minutes. Check in KGL was fine but slow. Could not check in my baggage to final destination but at least they could transfer it beyond DXB on another airline, which made me OK. Service onboard fully acceptable, 3 types of small, cold sandwiches on brown bread. Wines of RSA origin, acceptable but not memorable. Transit in NBO smooth, jetbridge deboarding and boarding. Flights were both full in economy cabin, but service inboard was managed well and thoroughly. No IFE on first flight. Detour to BJM very annoying. FAs were fine, nothing too much trouble. Due to delay on 2nd flight they granted me access to the wonderful Pride Lounge in NBO, that was a nice move, and I enjoyed really and filled up my depots. I love this lounge due to its space, curved form, good food, and views of tarmac. Second flight had IFE, good food, and generous drink rounds. I had lamb, 1 of 3 options for hot meal.

"Kenya Airways was supposed to transfer our luggage at JFK and take it to Madagascar. The bags did not arrive and Kenya Airways says none of the baggage claim numbers we have are of any use to them, our names are of no use to them, ticket numbers or anything, and there is nothing they can do to find or track the bags.

When we politely asked to speak to a manager, they hung up on us three times.

"On the morning of 31 July 2019, my husband and I took a flight from Kigali  (KQ 479) to Johannesburg via Nairobi. At Kigali we needed to check in an extra bag and were told we needed to pay for it in cash. We did not have enough cash on us and we were struggling with the ATMs. It was a really strenuous moment, there we were in a foreign land anxious to go home and it looked as though we would leave a bag behind. The Kenya Airways staff at the counter were supportive, empathetic and yet conscious not to delay the whole fight. eventually, we managed to scrap together the required cash and paid. Buy this time the flights about to close, we had RWF 50,000 and needed to have paid about RWF47,000. of course were weren't bothered with change at that point and were happy to just make it into our flight. Just before the flight doors closed, in entered the same Kenya Airways staff to who we had paid for the bags. he had rushed after us with the RWF 3,000 change. such honesty and diligence you do not see often. I am sad I did not get the gentleman's name.

The flights were on time and comfortable. Normally on long haul the cabin staff come round quite often but sadly this didn’t happen. Outbound we waited an hour and a half before we got a drink and a snack then a couple of hours for dinner. Inbound (morning flight) we had an orange juice and croissant as soon as we were airborne then waited 6.5 hours for a meal!!! My friend wanted some water and went to the galley where the crew were sat chatting. They ignored her and she had to interrupt their conversation before they got her some water.

"We will NEVER fly this airline again. We flew JFK to Nairobi non-stop on June 29th and returning on July 11th.
Firstly, the customer service is unbelievably terrible. Every stewardess on the airline was rude, dull, and never helped ever. They rolled and huffed and puffed their eyes when you kindly requested something as simple as some water (flight was over 14 1/2 hours).
Secondly, they refused to accommodate anyone for seat changes, even when the customer is paying the upcharge.
Third, we requested to get skymiles added from this trip and they refuse to give us our credit due to our ""class"". They are a part of the SkyTeam. We spent extra money on exit row seats and spent a lot of money for the tickets. How are we not getting any mileage credit built up from this. This is probably the number one reason I will never fly with this airline ever again. I am so angry with this.
Bathrooms were always dirty and never cleaned or restocked. There was several times that I had to walk to the back of the plane to find a stewardess and ask them to put more toilet paper in the bathroom or if there was any way they could clean the urine off the floor in every single one of the bathrooms.
We paid for exit seats for the additional leg room and the stewardesses never said anything to the 15 people that decided to congregate in my extra leg room area and stand there conversating for over 2 hrs. I asked them kindly to relocate several times and even said something to the stewardesses several times. Finally, they moved after I had to make them (very frustrating). I didnt pay all this extra money for me not to be able to extend my legs.

The only good thing I can say about this airline is they got us from point A to point B.

"I tried to check in for a 6pm flight only to discover it had been cancelled. After 45 minutes (at aud1.50 a minute) On the phone I finally arranged a refund and purchased a new ticket (aud380) for departure that night. Interestingly, when cancelling, I called Expedia who the ticket was booked thru. Expedia pleaded with Kenya airways in Nairobi only to be told kenya airways India office had to authorise the refund - go figure. Refund comes in 8 weeks :-(. In total about 200aud out of pocket as the new ticket is more expensive and the phone bill will be crazy. What is more worrying is the failure to inform passengers - it was lucky I tried to check in on line. I understand these things happen, especially in this part of the world but when were they planning to tell me, or Expedia.

As far as flights go tho, for a short 1hour hop to Zanzibar I was impressed. Smiling cabin crew, full drink service (x2) with a
Snack. Aircraft clean. On time departure and arrival.

Other minor issues; would have saved 15-20 mins had they distributed immigration forms (I saw a pile of them upon disembarkation) on board. The other minor issue - why depart at 00:15 for such a short flight. Cheapest ticket on these flights are over 300 bucks as you guys hold the monopoly on the route!

"Being PLATINUM members of the Sky Team we had the best extra leg room seats (row 11) in Economy Class. Preferred to take these seats as the flying time was barely over 3 hours.

Kenya Airways needs to improve on the following:

1] Unlike KLM we were never addressed by name;
2] The movie screen was loose and kept falling down;
3] The beef curry was terrible (half raw). The chicken curry and fish options we took on later fights were better options;
4] Crew barely smiled. Looked like they make the same trip twice a day;
5] Overhead baggage’s sometimes get full even above the passengers’ seats. It is highly inconvenient to keep bags in other places on the aircraft.

The flight was generally comfortable and my hats off to the pilots for steering the otherwise nice aircraft well. Landing was perfect.

"We flew with Kenya Airways last week for our summer holiday to Mauritius. We were flying on two flights-connecting at Nairobi, Kenya. On our first flight from Dubai, we boarded half an hour later than we were due to, this made us depart late and arrived late to Nairobi. The flight had TVs and food and drinks were served but only seen the attendants once or twice, the service was not satisfactory compared to other airlines. We were then due to fly from Nairobi to Mauritius at 1pm, but when we got off our first flight we read on the screen that we were delayed to 21:30pm- a 9.5 hour delay. We only knew about this delay from the screen no other information was given over a tannoy etc. We then by chance went to an information desk to ask why we were delayed. We were informed that the airline staff needed a rest break- we were annoyed at this as it shows how unorganised the airline is! Why do they not have enough staff? When we returned to the airport at 8:00pm for our delayed flight we went to the gate where yet again we were late boarding. We started boarding our flight at 21:30 even though the flight was meant to depart then! When we were getting our boarding passes checked at the gate, the staff member who was checking our passes instructed us to show her our hotel booking and our return flight (even though we were not flying with them on our return). I asked why she needed to see this information and she was very rude back not giving a reason just stating she needed to see both. We were not connected to Wifi or internet so this was merely impossible but she kept us back whilst letting other passengers on without any questions asked. This was very infuriating as we had been travelling now for nearly 16 hours. She EVENTUALLY let us on the flight as another colleague told her to let us on. The airline did not have TVs, little legroom and again the flight attendants were not present often. I will not be flying with KA again as the rudeness of the staff was unnecessary on top of the delayed flight. Please think twice before booking, I would rather pay more and get a friendly and efficient service with another Airline such as Emirates.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/81/default-avatar-2020-43.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LWa94,LW94 wrote a review Jul 2019,LW94,,4 contributions,1 helpful vote,Dubai - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r690854840-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Very unorganised and staff who were not interested- delayed flight,Date of travel: July 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Firstly, the food we got was seriously lousy. In addition, they had run out of chicken and fish, and my kids were unable to eat the lamb - so they went hungry for an 8 hour flight!! Also there was no option to choose a specific meal (like a kids meal) on line - like Emirates does. Very disappointing.

We tried to reserve our seats using the app and also online, but the only seats that didn't require a premium were in the back of the plane. Seriously KQ you don't need to milk your customers when your prices are already the highest in the market.

The air stewards were very unhelpful, didn't smile, and were unresponsive. KQ - I've never seen this in any other airline. What on earth are you doing to your staff?

On the second leg of the flight, my family was separated. We were unable to use reserve seats online (like most other airlines allow) and our family was booked on separate seats - this was very disappointing.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/d5/default-avatar-2020-17.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gnosti,Gnosti wrote a review Jul 2019,Gnosti,Kenya,20 contributions,4 helpful votes,Nairobi - Stockholm,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r690016155-Kenya_Airways-World.html,"Terrible food,  family separated, unable to reserve a seat",Date of travel: July 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Kenya Airways ironically boasts to be The pride of Africa .... seriously never again! I stopped over in Kenya and had a 7 hours stop over. However, as soon as I got there I got a text to say that my flight was going to be delayed for 5 hours with instructions to call the local number - on roaming s’il vous plaît! I then got another text to say that there would be a further delay. I received no instructions whatsoever on what to do and who to talk to at the airport.

I was then told to go to the information desk where I waited for almost two hours in a queue with only 10 people ahead of me and 3 members of staff and every so often some went missing for one reason or another ! Errr... definitely the longest queue ever. The poor two passengers ahead of me had to run for their planes,despite one of them having a disability (I hope they got it) after waiting for almost two hours as well-they we’re asked where have you been??!! They were waiting in your long queue!! The staff’s laid-back attitude and lack of customer service was appalling.

As for myself my long delay of eight hours resulted in two hours of queueing up only to be told that I was supposed to come in queue again to collect food vouchers. No way Jose! To crown it all, I’ve had to pay $40 to use the private lounge – which would not have been necessary had my plane left on time They should really change their name to the pride of utter chaos. #disappointed #where’s the customer service #kenya airlines 😒",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/08/6d/93/arvinam.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arvinam,Arvina M wrote a review Jul 2019,Arvina M,,21 contributions,2 helpful votes,London - Mahebourg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r689719055-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Kenya Airways is just so disappointing ,Date of travel: July 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I have been lucky on most of the flights, in that I have often had 3 seats to myself. I think that most people probably prefer other airlines, since they don't know much about Kenya Airways.

"The flight was delayed by 3.5 hours so we missed our flight from Niarobi to Heathrow. There was no information from the Kenya Airways staff and the information board continued to state that the flight was on time. Only after a large number of irate passemgers demanded to know what was going on, they said that the flight was delayed due to air traffic problems at Nairobi and no aircraft could take off. However, there was an aircraft due and that this would get us to Nairobi in time, and as many of us from many countries had connecting flights they would advise BA of the problem and they would hold up the Heathrow flight for us. When we arrived at Nairobi at 23.30, the gates were shut and the flight was taking off on time. BA denied receiving any contact from Kenya Airways.
BA were no help and told a large party of passengers to go to Kenya Airways ticket office as it was their fault and they should sort it out. They refused to speak to KA. So at midnight we had to queue at the KA ticket desk to try and book seats for the next day. Our contract was from Mombasa to Heathrow straight through so we had a free booking. Others who booked separate flights had to pay, one couple paying $2000 to get to London. We eventually got a flight at 8.00 the next morning to Amsterdam and to London City Airport. Our luggage arrived 4 days later.
During the flight over, we had a 2 hour wait at Nairobi as the aircraft for Mombasa had not arrived.

I was not happy with the flight delays. This happened on both my routes. On my final check in I was told the flight was full and finally was able to check in. However another lady actually got on the plane only to not have a seat and we were further delayed because she understandably did not want to get off. The aircon on the night flight was just too cold and for some reason could not be regulated properly. I caught another bout of flu because of that.

"My initial experience using KQ from Dar to MRU was okay with almost little hustle. However that experience was ruined on my returning flight. Upon check in we were informed that the flight will be delayed but I was till assured that I will be on time for my connecting flight. As I was travelling at night and wasnt able to have a once of sleep during the flight. I was looking forward to my connecting flight to dar where I had booked a hotel to rest.

Due to the delay and the fact that we stayed in the plane for more than 20 minutes after landing I ended up missing my connecting flight. They have a customer service desk at the airport which proved to be useless considering the level of service I received. The lady was impolite and I was simply told we have put you in the next flight which was 7 hours later and gave me a voucher for breakfast (which was the worst thing ever. one piece of toast and an egg which is fried in too much oil.) Considering that they made me miss my reservation at the hotel that I was staying at when I asked the lady if there will be any compensation for the booking that I was missing due to all these unnecessary changes. I was told that whatever arrangement I had after the booking was non of their business. So I ended up missing my $120 amount that I paid for the one night hotel in Dar.

Considering the level of the company and the service that I received from them. I wouldnt recommend anyone.

"I recently had to reschedule my flight form Nairobi. I called the customer service while still in the country and despite spending close to an hour the issue was never resolved. At one point the customer care on the other side hanged up on me. I was told i could not get a flight on the day i wanted unless i went via Uganda and this was adding 3 hours to my journey. When it was finally sorted i was told i had to pay $800 and bear in mind my return ticket was £679. I begrudgingly accepted it as i had no choice.They then said they could not take the payment over the phone despite telling them i had a Visa Card, instead i was referred to make my payment in Kisumu where i was the next day which was a Saturday. The office opened at 9am and i was there , on checking the Sales & Ticketing guy tells me my ticket was only valid until 6am despite the office opening at 9am.  The gentleman in Kisumu was very good after i told him what i had been through the previous evening despite me making the call my self and even asking to speak to the supervisor who i was put through but had to hang up after being online for over 20min waiting. The Kisumu office reassured me they would sort this out and they did. Not only did they get me the flight i wanted but they also find a flight for $160 only.

"We chose to fly from Amsterdam to Madagascar with Kenya Airways, since we wanted to prevent flying with Air France (their staff tends to strike ever so often).

We were delayed both getting there and going back again.
The first time around the delay happened, because apparantly there is an extra hop in Moroni on the Comoros islands between Nairobi and Antananarivo. This information was not shared when booking the flight. Because of this hop, delay is practically inevitable. It took forever for people to get off and on the plane again. Since Antananarivo was our final destination, it did not cause us any troubles.
It became a problem when we wanted to get back home again after our holiday. Once again, the hop in Moroni took too long, so the plane arrived an hour late, which caused us to miss our connecting flight in Nairobi. Even though we missed the flight by 10 minutes, and the connecting flight was still standing at the gate right next to the one we arrived at, they decided not to wait for us and several other passengers.
After missing the flight, sadly, we had to deal with their customer service, which meant that we were sent everywhere throughout Nairobi airport, dealing with staff that could not care less, and each and every one of them told us different stories where to go to. I lost count of the amount of times we had to go through airport security again and again and again. It was a very frustrating process to go through.

Needless to say we were very happy that the next flight leaving for Amsterdam was a KLM flight! Still, Murphy's law applied, so of course our luggage got lost as well for three days.

The entertainment on the first Kenya Airways flight from Amsterdam to Nairobi was OK, were it not for my headphone jacket to be broken (several other passengers experienced the same problem), so I could not watch any movies whatsoever, which sucks on a 7+ hours night flight. Also, you barely get any water, even though their planes are unusually hot. It caused me to have a severe cough for about a week and a half. They serve your food within one hour after departing, and after that you will barely see the staff again.

Next time around, I'd rather risk a strike than ever flying with Kenya Airways again. I've flown quite a lot already, but never have I experienced an Airline this disorganized.

When I read other comments on here as well, it seems they're delayed quite often, caused by their own incompetence. Please consider this before booking a flight with Kenya Airways.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zjan1991,Jeanne wrote a review Jul 2019,Jeanne,,1 contribution,,Antananarivo - Amsterdam,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r688063069-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Worst airline experience so far,Date of travel: June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Our flight was supposed to leave Cape Town to Zanzibar via Nairobi at 23h00 on June 27th 2019.
Once we got to the airport, we were advised that our flight was delayed by almost 3 hours due to a signal issue in Nairobi.
We asked if this would affect our connecting flight to Zanzibar - and we were met with lies, head shaking and smiles.
When we arrived in Nairobi, we learned that our connecting flight had left us behind. We were immediately advised that we had been booked for an alternative flight to Dar-Es-Salaam. When we enquired about our luggage that had been checked in all the way to Zanzibar, we were told not to worry, that our luggage would be going on all flights along with us.

To cut a long story short, whe we arrived in Zanzibar, almost 7 hours later than intended, our luggage was missing.

It was a mission tracking it down as, although they have an app, email, telephones and social media, Kenya Airways does not care to communicate with their passangers.

Regretfully, our flight back was with Kenya Airways... And just as I thought it could not possibly get worse, our flight was cancelled a few hours before we were to board.

"Pride of Africa.. Best Airline in Africa.. Slogans that are as big a lie as the company itself. Leaving Capetown for Europe we were informed at the airport at23h00 that the flight was cancelled due to fog in cape Town.. On investigation it was found that the plane had not even left nairobi!!!!! Lie!!! To exonerate themselves as weather cannot be controlled. We reached our destination 36 hours later (not with Kenyan airline)
As we were going on a trip due to a family emergency it was important to be able to be flexible on return. This was agreed to by the Kenyan airline. When this option was to be requested it was not possible except for for expensive upgrades... LIE!!! The Nairobi layover was to be longer but if exceeds 8hours they will either Lounge us or place us into hotel.. LIE!!! NOT EVEN A CUP OF COFFEE WAS OFFERED.. IT WAS ANNOUNCED INSTEAD THAT THE FLIGHT WAS GOING TO BE DELAYED ANOTHER 3 HOURS.
I managed to negotiate a Kenyan airline flight via Johannesburg.. On arrival all our luggage has gone missing..
Incompetence all round. No sense of urgency.. They all believe that they are a great airline when in fact they are nothing more than a pretentious second grade mess.
Food wise:I have flown millions of km but have never ever received such crappy food. The entertainment system can only be laughed at. Thumbs down all around. The blanked offered in economy is another joke...the groundstaff and service :Incompetence at its best.. For anyone wanting to travel and considering Kenyan airways... You have been warned....!!! Rather use ethiopian or othe African airlines.

"First, the flight was delayed by almost 3 hours. Then, once we prepared, we were kept standing on the bus for another 30 minutes with no circulation till a couple of passengers decided to get off and wait outside. We did not receive any form of communication from any of the ground staff. Once we boarded, we met this very rude hostess named JUNE, who gave this condescending look to most of us.
As she served snacks, most of the passengers did not get even get napkins, mere serviettes!!!!!!
JUNE got to my seat and asked what I would have and I asked for the nuts to which she replied: "" I said, beef or chicken!"" I insisted on the nuts and she said she would check but never got back to me.

"Travelled DXB-NBO-KGL on 30th June 2019 on B787-800 and E190, respectively. My ticket was in economy and very cheap. I bid for an upgrade for the 1st leg and it was accepted 2 days before and they reissued ticket. However, due to serious delays by Cathay Pacific entering Dubai (from Saigon and Hongkong), I realised almost a day before that I would not be able to make my trip from DXB. I cancelled my online check-in’s to avoid No Show, but had to forfeit upgrade and tickets according to fare rules. However, KQ, and in particular the Station Manager in DXB, went the extra mile to still get me on board on the following flight 5 hours later on the same day. This, without reissuing tickets (which were non refundable), without charging me for No Show, without loosing my upgrade, just out of courtesy, empathy and a well explained case from my side. At gate in DXB, I was the last person (had only 40 Minutes for transfer, so got a good morning run!), but KQ issued all my BPs in 2 Minutes during last call. Onboard, spacious cabin, got seat 2C in a nice 2 x 2 x 2 configuration. Flight full except a few seats in business. Good food and kind, attentive FAs. A decent airline respecting classic values and handles “ground situations” or irregularities well. Not the first time they have done small miracles for me. In NBO, I was kindly invited to the KQ Pride lounge that Skyteam uses. Just a courtesy due to my endured inconveniences.  Last leg on an E190, I love this aircraft. Dinner and drinks served in a good atmosphere due to fresh FAs. Well done, KQ, outstanding service: I owe you for this one! And my home-travel is still valid. What more could you have done?

"We, a family of three, flew with Kenya Airways for the first time and were not sure what to expect. Overall we were quite satisfied. Very punctual, friendly cabin crews, clean aircrafts. On the way back from Nairobi to Cape Town there was no entertainment system, which was sad on a nearly 6 hours flight. We also experienced a 3 hours delay in Nairobi on our way back home, but that was not caused by the airline, it was a weather issue in Cape Town as we were told. Nairobi airport however is not a pleasant place. Probably the worst airport we/I have seen. Old, poor offer on restaurants/cafés, rather dirty. This is strange since Nairobi may be a hub for eastern Africa, one could immagine. But again, we cannot say much against the Airline though. They definitely beat American Airlines though (that was our worst airline experience so far a few years ago).",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bonsee,MarMont wrote a review Jun 2019,MarMont,"Cape Town, South Africa",7 contributions,2 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Zanzibar Island,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r685189298-Kenya_Airways-World.html,First time and quite ok,Date of travel: June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

So this flight from NY to Kenya was a first for me. Needless to say they keep you entertained. Plenty of movies and shows, but my issue was the continuity options.
They will have part 1 of 3 movies but not the last two. I am sure its a licensing thing, but when you look forward to the hobbit or lord of the rings x3 to kill 10+ hours, and only get 3 out of each, you end up sad.

On both segments KQ101 and KQ100 the trips were pleasant. I flew KQ after some time as previously their service had deteriorated considerably. On these flights things had improved right from the check in to the overall flight experience. The cabin crew went out of their way to make your experience a pleasant one and plenty of smiles all around. The 787 was clean and comfortable one with plenty of leg room. Entertainment was good and food had improved considerably. Veg options were readily available but you can book a special needs meal in advance. Both flights were on time which was a change from my previous experience.A good duty free selection on flight with reasonable prices. KQ have a generous baggage allowance on this sector hence most of their flights are full but they make sure your check in is swift with the minimum of fuss.

I flew from DXB to Nairobi as part of my return journey.  The flight was on time and boarding was smooth. Leg room was Ok but not great for an over five hour journey. The plane was a Boeing 737. I do think single aisle planes are definitely less comfortable than twin aisled ones. Space is more limited and there are limited rest rooms. Airlines are increasingly using the single aisled planes for longer and longer flights and this decreases customer comfort. The touch screen was sluggish. The food was Ok. Nothing great. Kenyan coffee is good. Rich and smooth. The flight landed on time. The flight attendants were helpful. Overall an acceptable flight.

"Kenya Airline is the worst airline I have ever used they clearly do not know the meaning of time keeping
1. My fly was from Zimbabwe to Malawi on the 10th of June which was meant to be for 1:25 am and was delayed with 2 hours and without any explanation on what was going on the plan later on arrived at 3:40
2. The plan from Malawi to Nairobi on the 15th of June was delayed it was meant to be 9:40 and did not leave till 10:15. Which meant I missed my connecting flight to Zimbabwe, which was not my fault
3. I was then told the next available flight was 22:50 and was offered hotel accommodation at Weston hotel , where I was meant to have lunch and dinner, but was only given lunch and the stuff stated dinner would not be ready till 7pm when they had in the first place said 6:30pm, and the pick up but was supposed to come 7pm but showed up the meant we had to go without having dinner
4. Once at the airport the flight was again DELAYED of 22:50 it was 23:30
5. Got to Zimbabwe and my bags had been left in Kenya and didn’t arrive till the following day 16th of June @ 16:30 and I was catching a flight to London that evening with a different airline, I could have nearly missed my bags due to Kenya Airways lack of organisation

"Typically, I only write reviews if service has been so terrible that I’m trying to get some recourse to solve an issue. First, I was never notified that one of my connecting flights from Cairo to Kenya was cancelled. I’ve found out that the main reason I came to Cairo has been cancelled and need to change my flight in order to go back to work before my scheduled flight, this is how I found out about the flight cancellation.

Secondly, I attempted to contact Kenya Airways through multiple different avenues, by phone, email, and live chat. I have records of how many attempts I made to contact them via email and have not heard any response. When I would call, no one would pick up, and when I used the Live Chat, it would constantly disconnect and it would take 30 minutes for someone to even come to the chat room to help me. After getting frustrated and being unable to resolve the problem. I found out that it would be cheaper for me to have my flight refunded and purchase a new one. I made two requests online to have my flight refunded but again, no one has gotten back to me.

Finally, I contact the office in Cairo and all they could offer me was a flight change, with no cost, on a day that I cannot take (June 30th, which would be too late) or a flight change on June 29th, but with a $550 increase, it would be much cheaper for me to just buy a new ticket elsewhere. After all this trouble over the past four days, I expect some compensation or assistance. At this point, I hope you will take this matter seriously and I wish to be fully covered for the flight on June 29 that was offered to me, or a full refund for the flight I have already purchased. I have never experienced such terrible communication with an airline before and I am extremely disappointed. My next step is to contact the Key Executives and Board Members of your airline, which I have a list of:

Michael Joseph, Sebastian Mikosz, Jason Kap-kirowk, Caroline Armstrong-Ogwapit, Martin Luke Oduor-Otieno, among many others. I look forward to hearing back from you promptly. I hope we will find a mutual resolution to this issue.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/23/default-avatar-2020-28.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M9076ABjessc,Jess C wrote a review Jun 2019,Jess C,,1 contribution,,Cairo - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r682857049-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Absolutely terrible...,Date of travel: June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"i’m writing regarding an absolutely terrible experience I had flying with your Kenya airlines for my honeymoon. Our trip was supposed to be NBO-ZNZ-NBO-LHR. After 3 days in Nairobi we landed in Zanzibar on 4th June to be told we required a referral visa and therefore were not permitted entry. We were then told we were being returned to Nairobi on the next flight (Boarding Pass, Bags Tag and Immigration Document) all to Nairobi. Our original return to London was originally scheduled for the 8th so we were informed we would do well to find somewhere to go in Kenya so we headed to Mombasa to salvage the rest of our honeymoon. Paying for extra flights and hotels in the process.

Upon time to leave on the 8th June for London we were informed at checking that we infact had a flight for the 5th to London booked by the Kenya Airways representatives at Zanzibar. This flight was never communicated to us in any form (I had emails from after the flight on 5th asking if I’ll require an upgrade for my flight on the 8th).

We arrived at the airport in Nairobi at 5:30am at which point we had 3.5hours to resolve the issue. It initially started with the sales representative and manager claiming our boarding passes for 5th June were printed. After digging into it they then realised not only was it not printed but we weren’t even checked in. We were made to sit in the sales office with the promise that someone had spoken to the controller only to then be told we weren’t boarding our intended flight with no compensation for the now extra day we’d spend in Nairobi (more costs incurred due to Kenya Airways).

Fast forward to the following day and we were able to obtain a ticket on the London flight. After going through check-in, passport control and security I was stopped at the boarding gate as they refused to accept my residence permit for the UK (it was checked and validated at checking and passport control. This is a permit I’ve been flying with for 8 years with several UK entry stamps in my passports (new and old) all referring to the said document number.

I was now staying in Kenya for another day as it was Sunday and contacting the embassy wasn’t an option (incurring more costs). My partner who is a UK citizen got on the flight as she was informed she’d have to pay for a whole new ticket if she decided to stay. Upon arrival in London my partner was shocked to hear they hadn’t loaded our bags onto the plane despite checking them in a day early for the flight. In fact I was left in Kenya with no funds or clothes and she was now in England with none of our luggage.

Kenya airways offered no compensation at any point for the now 3 nights we had to spend in Nairobi.

I had to rebook through KLM the following day (more costs), who were happy with the same document and travel to the UK and the UK authorities were also happy to accept me back home.

Now the luggage has arrived, the case as well as things within the case are damaged.

So my honeymoon (once in a lifetime experience) was essentially completely ruined by Kenya Airways. Me and my partner believe that we were treated unfairly and discriminated by Kenya airways based on my passport and being a western African national.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I19PNelizabetha,Elizabeth A wrote a review Jun 2019,Elizabeth A,"London, United Kingdom",5 contributions,2 helpful votes,London - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r682625708-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Honeymoon Nightmare- Worst experience ever,Date of travel: June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We flew to Kilimanjaro, Tanzania on KLM, and then had to go to Mombasa via Nairobi on Kenya Airways.

Leg 1 - Kilimanjaro to Nairobi, business class. Had to pay for extra bag (we had three bags between two people). No big deal. Flight was on time, good flight.

Leg 2 - Nairobi to Mombasa. This was now a domestic flight so we had to lug all our luggage to the domestic terminal after fetching it in Nairobi and clearing Customs. Again no big deal and expected. However, the Business class lounge in Nairobi domestic terminal was very small and we had to sit outside for hours awaiting our connecting flight.

Leg 3 - Mombasa to Nairobi - this was the flight from hell! Got delayed 3 1/2 hours (several other flights also got delayed - all Kenya airways) and we had only 30 minutes to spare to get from the domestic terminal in Nairobi, to the International terminal, go through security twice (two different areas) plus go through outgoing immigration. We barely made it and were the last ones to board our flight to Paris with minutes to spare. We would like to thank Vivian of Kenya Airlines in Mombasa for helping us get through some issues with luggage and going above and beyond. She is a good employee!

Leg 4 - Nairobi to Paris. This was an uneventful flight. However, it should be noted that Kenya Airlines served very basic and cheap food for an international flight.

Note to Kenya Air - You may need to invest in some research as to what other airlines do and not cut corners on business class meals!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/415samb,Sam B wrote a review Jun 2019,Sam B,"Seattle, Washington",88 contributions,82 helpful votes,Nairobi - Paris,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r682483605-Kenya_Airways-World.html,A variety of experiences on four different legs!,Date of travel: June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Myself and my daughter traveled with Kenya airways on our holiday this year.
Zanzibar airport staff who worked for Kenya airways are rude and unhelpful, the airport is unfinished and the toilets are disgusting.
Our flight to Nairobi to catch our onward flight home to Uk was cancelled this we couldn’t make the connection
We where then delayed by over 24 hours.
The staff in Nairobi airport again working for Kenya airways where rude and unhelpful.
It took over 14 hours to get from Zanzibar to a hotel in Nairobi due to the red tape and silliness of their system.
In all that time 1am to 3pm we only got a small bottle of water and a small veggie samosa.
This is disgusting treatment.
I have put a claim into insurance and Kenya airways however I would advise anyone to avoid the airline completely as flights are regularly cancelled due to lack of passengers, according to one member of staff in Zanzibar airport and tech faults, in fact on one plane we went on smoke appeared from the engine twice just before take off.

"This airline has ruined my holiday. I was booked onto flight to Seychelles due to arrive at 5pm and two days before was pushed onto a flight that arrived at 2am(!), which was an hour delayed and thus arrived at 3am. Apparently the airline hasn’t updated its schedules and so passengers innocently book onto flights that don’t exist. This ruined the start of my holiday.

I’m now supposed to return to South Africa and am stranded at Seychelles airport. It is 10pm, my flight was supposed to have left at 6pm. I will miss my connection to Johannesburg and now have a long layover in Nairobi, missing work tomorrow as I arrive at 11am, rather than when I was supposed to arrive into Joburg. This has ruined the end of my holiday and my work week, as I will no doubt be underslept and exhausted when I eventually get in.

One way flights are significantly more expensive than round trip flights, so I booked my round trip flight with a connection in Kenya. This way, I could travel to a couple of nearby countries (including Kenya) and then jump on the second connection flight from Kenya to the USA (by missing my first flight from Malawi to Kenya). This would have made my travels throughout Africa work out seamlessly. We called the company to ensure everything would work out, and they told us that we have to buy a completely new one way trip back to America if we miss any one of the bundled flights...even though we are already paying an incredible amount for this set of flights. This money-hungry company THREW A HUGE WRENCH IN MY ENTIRE VACATION. I now may never get a chance to visit Kenya or the other countries that I planned to visit.  It should be the customer's choice how they want to travel and use the flights that they paid for. The customer does NOT come first for Kenya Airways. I am disgusted with this service. (Also, this is incredibly stupid business move since you just lost your country hundreds of dollars in tourism from the flights and hotels that I would've paid for to travel in Kenya before heading back to America.)",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/7c/01/default-avatar-2020-5.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TakeMeAnywhere12,Traveler wrote a review Jun 2019,Traveler,,1 contribution,,Lilongwe - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r680951465-Kenya_Airways-World.html,The Customer Does NOT Come First,Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

This was a long flight - Johannesburg to Nairobi on the Embraer (4 hours) and then Nairobi to Dakar via Mali (9 hours) on a 737 -700. Reviews of Kenya Airways aren’t generally great but I found their business class service of a high standard. It was a long way to go in a narrow bodied aircraft so you cannot compare the seating with the lie flat seats of most wide bodied aircraft but it was very comfortable nevertheless. Both flights were on time and transiting through Nairobi airport was quick and easy. All in all a much better experience than I had expected.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/d1/e5/dd/david-g.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David312578,David G wrote a review Jun 2019,David G,"Johannesburg, South Africa",552 contributions,158 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Dakar,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r680253168-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Really good service and professional crew,Date of travel: June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I used to travel from Dubai to Douala with another company but two weeks ago I booked my flight with Kenya Airways, arriving in Douala I don't see any of my suitcases.
I complained about my lost luggage at the airport and they asked my to provide them all the documents and I did it until know I haven't received my suitcases. More than two weeks can't you imagine, I am not able to get my suitcases. My husband is still in Dubai complaining about this to the airport but as per them the bags have been sent to Kenya.

"Travelled both ways between Nairobi and Mombasa, the flight to Mombasa was Ok, on a smaller plane with less than 100 seats, it was comfortable enough and we did get a drink and snack.
The duration is only about an hour, so it was really disappointing that the return was delayed by an hour, this meant that by the time we got to Nairobi our onward flight was showing as boarding and it deprived us of time to have a good look round the duty free which we had intended to do.
Apart from this, there were no other problems and check-in was easy, although you do have to leave one terminal and go outside to get to the other terminal which would be unsatisfactory if it were raining.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/a7/default-avatar-2020-44.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/681richarde,Richard E wrote a review Jun 2019,Richard E,"Alexandria, United Kingdom",170 contributions,166 helpful votes,Nairobi - Mombasa,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r679707757-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Short fight with long delay,Date of travel: May 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Now,like i said in one post,i have used Kenya airways before...and not much to complain about!!

This time,i had the opportunity to use it right into its home,JKIA! To and from Entebbe.
I had some some documental issues,which i explained to them and the two ladies just made me cry(situation was tight,but they felt my pain,confusion and frustration i teared up)
Three supervisors i found on duty-sadly,i didnt get the two ladie's names-one very light skinned,short neat hair,glasses. Another was tall,puffed hair,a bit dark,warm,kind(this was around 330/4:00,on 4th.06.2019!) These two are my Kenya Airways Heroes in JKIA!! It was a job,but they went above and beyond!! Thank you!!!
Then night time-Sam finished what the ladies started!!
So,you three are fit to be in those positions!!! Like,For one staff,a lady, didnt want to listen to my woes,she just told me""go to counter number 1,but dont tell them i sent you!!!""
Although,the young lady,who had a cold,(counter number 5 this same evening) kept checking and asking if yhings have been sorted! Poor thing did her best to help out,till situation had to be taken to her supervisors.
Thank you KQ!
And both flights were with no glitches! Always professionals.

"We will never ever use this airline again. Tired to save some money by using this airline and got what we deserved. First on our way back from Mumbai they stop us at the check in for over 30 min at 5:30 am to get a doc confirmation in freaking Nairobi that my son is good to fly as we came from a stem cell procedure and it wasn’t enough the letter from the hospital doctors. Not easy to explain an autistic 6 years old why we not going on our way. Than on the flight from Nairobi to Capetown my husband got very sick and I had to asked for help as he already used all the vomit bags they had and running high fever and they just gave me an upset face and saying sorry we don’t have any pain killers, they did not offer any help  so I asked them can you please bring a doc to the plane when we land as my husband is very very sick so the head flight attendant said “we can do it but only after all the people go” and I said what if my husband is dying here still no comment. Thank god for Capetown airport helpers, which help us get out of the airport quickly to go to the hospital.

"Travelled ADD-DJB-NBO-KGL on 16-17th May 2019 on B737 and E90, respectively. Got my ticket reissued in airport in ADD due to No Show (I was late from previous connection on different ticket). That costed me 300 usd, same amount as I paid for original (return) ticket. The Station Manager in ADD went the extra mile to get me onwards the same day and he invited me to the Ethiopian Gold Lounge, that Skyteam uses.
Service onboard fair, but food is ridiculous and substandard. They serve only microscopic meals, e.g. a little-finger sized hot roll snack from ADD to NBO (5 hours trip). That’s stingy. In NBO I had to spent the night but fortunately KQ granted me lounge access due to all the trouble that I have had. The prestigious lounge has food, views, and nice architecture with curving designs and view of tarmac. It has 6 beds in silent area and I slept well till next morning. Flights less than ½ hours delayed. NBO-KGL on the Embraer was delayed due to passengers could not fit their overhead luggage into the narrow space and some 5-10 pax was deprived their luggage to have it inscribed on site and put down in luggage room until we reached KGL.

"Transited in BKK from Vietnam and boarded after midnight 15th May 2019. Aircrafts were the old Dreamliner 787-800 and 737, respectively. I like KQ (we have had our issues…). In BKK they were professional and appeared as a true legacy carrier This, even I travelled on a strongly promoted ticket. Smooth cooperation with KQ and the AF lounge in BKK allowed me to relax in the lounge 6 hours until Kenya Airways could issue all 4 Boarding Passes of my ongoing trip to Kigali via Addis. Buying 2 tickets with complicated routing (married segments) turned out to be much cheaper than go direct. But time spent increases; likewise the risk of lapses. All flights punctual. Food only passable, only 2 options offered and only cold dishes for dinner. No cheese, no ice-cream. Other airlines do better in Economy regarding food. Drinks also very narrow offering with 2 industrial, cheap beers. Same for wines: only 1-2 options. Champagne offered (on both flights) was fine: JM Gobillard & Fils. The Dreamliner offer a very boring and cramped layout of 2 x 2 x 2 in 5 rows. Business almost full (only 4 vacant seats) and economy completely full (but no operational upgrades were done). Second flight almost empty. Poor food, only a quiche in a paper box offered as breakfast. And, this was business class..?? FAs in excellent mood.

"Initial flight via Nairobi pushed back from 1910 to 0250 - that is a bad time to fly. Notwithstanding the airport was empty they still managed to get away another 30 minutes late. No apology and no compensation offered . Not even a drink. I am now seriously out of pocket as we had originally a planned stop over of 11 hours so had paid for transit visa and hotel rooms which could not be cancelled.
Kenya Airways way of dealing is for the Customer Services desk go record the detail and then do nothing about it - now don't even respond to mail. Appalling service. The check in at Mauritius was painfully slow and they managed to lose a cabin bag. Honestly life is about choices - use another airline.

"My flight was delayed returning to UK from Harare. There was no communication prior to my arrival at Harare airport. It took me an hour waiting in the queue before l managed to speak to someone. I was booked on the next available flight which was leaving in 8hrs time.
I was given a Holiday Inn voucher for a room and meals and was told that a shuttle bus was going to pick me up at 22:30 to take me back to the airport.
When l arrived at Holiday Inn, there were no rooms available and staff had suggested booking me at the Crown plaza which l refused as this would have caused confusion with the shuttle bus pick up time.
I was offered to seat in the staff lounge and l rested on the sofa. Came out at 22:10 to wait for my transport back to the airport. Another passenger was also waiting for the same transport since 21:30 as their slot was at that time. Which meant the transport was 40 minutes late.
We waited together until 22:45 and definitely no one was coming to pick us up and boarding was commencing at 23:30.
There was no contact number for anyone to tell us what was going on.
We arranged our on transport to get back to the airport which was very inconveniencing as someone had to wake up to take us and roads are not that safe.
When we got to the airport, there was no explanation as to why we were not picked up. We were told to contact their offices in the morning as there were closed.

"This review is of a flight from JFK to Dar es Salaam connecting in Nairobi and return. I hold a Gold Medallion Status on Delta Airlines, with whom KQ is a SkyTeam partner. I shall rate this airline under three rubrics: Counter service, Cabin service and Customer service.
*COUNTER service - outward journey*
We checked in at JFK with no issues. As a Gold Medallion Delta customer, I received Sky Priority Status on KQ. My wife, as my travel companion on the same reservation, also received Sky Priority status. The counter clerk was friendly and efficient. The boarding process is a bit chaotic. KQ does not have clearly bordered-off lanes, so passengers cluster and converge, causing priority boarders to find themselves prevented by economy boarders, thus nullifying the priority boarding process.
*CABIN service - outward journey*
I did not find a ""wow!"" moment with any of KQ's meals. I found the flight attendants to be reasonably attentive, but not necessarily eager to please. My next comments are among the chief reasons I shall never fly KQ on a long distance flight ever again. First, for a transatlantic aircraft involving a 14 hour flight to have no wifi is like having a flight with no electricity. But wait! There WAS no electricity (in a manner of speaking) on this flight in my seat. The entertainment system did not work. OK, so I could entertain myself by reading, I thought. Hell no! Neither did the overhead lamp work. This was true of all the persons in 19 G, H, and J, and the fellow in 18 G appeared to have the same problem. This was no mere inconvenience; it resulted in loss of work; for I did have work to complete while flying which I now could not; already disadvantaged by the lack of wifi which I had already anticipated. My wife was in 19 F. I and the 19 H passenger drew the attention to these fails more than once to more than three flight attendants. No change of seat was offered economy appeared to be full) and as a priority boarder who entered among the first batch of economy boarders, I noted that business class was nearly empty. Still, the flight attendants offered no apology or options - just surprise that the systems did not work. Make your own conclusion from those details.
*CUSTOMER service - between outward and inward journeys*
This is where KQ has completely lost me. I wrote KQ customer service, indicating the problems outlined above, and suggested (knowing it might have been a long shot) that a fair compensation for the inconvenience and loss of work could be an upgrade to business class on the return home. Even though KQ's automated response says they prioritize upcoming flights issues, I had to write KQ twice - once two days after arrival, and another time four days later (two days before departure) to get a response. The response was not only disappointing, but left me embarrassed at the airline. I felt like I was dealing with a child, caught with hands in the cookie jar and yet claiming it was his sister who was stealing the cookies.
KQ responded that only ONE entertainment cluster on the entire aircraft did not work and that ""the flight attendants resolved the matter satisfactorily."" They indicated that they could not upgrade us to business class, and ended the email with an apology for the entertainment module (no apology for loss of work, no reference to overhead light, and NO alternative compensation offered for the inconvenience suffered for 14 hours, or my loss of work.
I replied to KQ, trying to remain calm, trying to avoid calling them a liar, and trying to avoid threatening to use all my influence to warn Delta that this airline could tank their record. I succeeded in being polite and calm and used the carrot rather than stick. I never got a response. It is embarrassing for an international airline to LIE and be defensive about a failure rather than accept responsibility and compensate the passenger reasonably. I can't spend my money on KQ again, unless I have no other serious choice.
Before I made this trip, I addressed a question about expectations regarding my Medallion status and transferring of benefits to KQ from DL. Although Delta responded later, KQ's response was more vague than DL's (neither answered as clearly as I think they could have, my specific questions).
*COUNTER service - inward journey*
Because of a crowd at the baggage counters, I and my wife ended up being checked in at NBO separately. Only when we cleared immigration did we notice that we both had boarding passes in -- get this -- my name and both, naturally, included ""sky priority."" So we proceeded to the lounge expecting that the error would be sorted out while we rested. Because KQ did not grant my wife the same sky priority status as they did on the outward journey, we ended up having to pay for her use of the lounge.
*CABIN service - inward journey*
You won't be surprised to learn that my wife's seat, 20F, would not recline. For 16 hours (the flight was delayed) she sat upright. I am not going to bother complaining, lest KQ lies again. Additionally, the flight attendants this time were not as service-oriented as they were before. Drinks were at a minimum; the food was noticeably of a lesser quality.
During a portion of the flight, I felt unwell, and alerted my wife that I thought I was going to faint or otherwise pass out (I know this feeling and I'm both surprised and grateful that it did not eventually happen). During that time, she went to the galley at the rear (she did not use call button) and mentioned this to a flight attendant who asked the seat number. She said she thought the attendant would come by to investigate. It never happened. Perhaps they might have, if an emergency did arise.
For short flights, with no competition, I'll fly KQ. Next time I'm crossing the Atlantic, or several time zones, somebody else will have the pleasure of welcoming me aboard - not Kenya Airways.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/a7/default-avatar-2020-44.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BloomingMisfit,BloomingMisfit wrote a review May 2019,BloomingMisfit,"Naugatuck, Connecticut",205 contributions,81 helpful votes,New York City - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r671795068-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Customer Service And Poor Equipment Will Defame This Airline,Date of travel: April 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The airline that ambitiously calls itself 'The pride of Africa' puts up a show that is consistent with its word.

The website works well, the boarding process (with the plane full) was calm and orderly. Entertainment was limited in choice but otherwise acceptable. The plane was new and clean. There was no punctuality issue.

Cabin staff deserves a special mention: resolutely Kenyan-looking staff, biomechanically apt for running quicker and looking better, and doing their job quite well.

All in all, in the present case, we can witness that the airline delivered as announced: pride but no arrogance.

"Our family of four decided to visit our native country, Nigeria, this past Easter. The first time in over seven years for us. We looked for a direct flight, and we found it difficult getting one, mostly due to the current state of Nigeria’s air travel. We settled for Kenya Airways, partly because it is an African airline partly because they just opened up their New York to Nairobi route, and partly because it was affordable. This has now become the worse decision we have made as a family. The first leg of our trip from New York to Nairobi on April 17, started off well for us. We took the family car, to the airport. I took our luggages inside; we were there 1 1/2 hours before scheduled takeoff. Their representatives at the airport starting checking us in and, I got the clear from them to go and park the car at the JFK’s airport long term parking, while they continued our check-in at the counter for us with my wife and kids. Right before I reach the long term parking at JFK airport, my wife called. She said that the airline representatives at the counter said two of our three luggage’s were overweight, they were insisting on us paying $200 in fees for that, In spite of the fact we were entitled to eight pieces of luggage for four of us, and we only took three. My wife was not with her cards there, or cash, she asked them if they would agree to use the card number, Apple Pay or other forms of payment, they refused.  I was also begging them to wait on the phone, I was about 2- 5 mins away from the boarding desk, as I had called an Uber to take me there instead of using an air train. They representatives refused and proceed to snatch the boarding pass and out baggage tags from my wife’s hands, while she was carrying our 11-month-old in one hand and out 5-year old in the other. I got there within the 2-5 minutes with 49 minutes to takeoff. They had closed their counter, they had no staff insight, and neither did they have an office in New York, as we got to find out. We started calling their phone number listed for U.S., the people we spoke with refused to be helpful in any way, either with us boarding the flight or giving us the next flight, demanding that we pay over $4000 for the airline to take us to Lagos, Nigeria. We were stranded at the airport after the flight left with a few other passengers throughout the afternoon. In-between the back and forth between us, the airline and the booking agents, Cheap-o-Air, we decided to take another flight. There times we put them all on conference calls to try and find a solution(s). Including calling Kenya Airways head office in Nairobi, Kenya.  We spent over six hours between me and my wife, trying to find a solution with no success of any kind. Then next thing we tried to do for us to go our trip was to try book a flight with Air Italy, which was the only airline that had a flight which could take us to Nigeria, that day. They had a flight was to leave at 8.30 p.m., that day.  Only to find out our luggage’s had left with the airline to Nairobi, contrary everything they said, including the threats, assaults and intimidations at the Kenya Airways boarding gate previously that day. We could not leave with the Air Italy flight that day. We went home and manage to book a flight with Air Morocco for that Friday at 2 a.m., while trying to sort things out with the airline to get compensation. We started the process for next couple days of trying to get our luggage delivered to us where ever we would be, because of time our constraints, brought about by this fiascos. We got to Lagos, Nigeria on Saturday morning at 5 a.m., we went to Kenya airways office and could not get our bags. After a back and forth with the Kenyan airways officials at the airport, we located our bags that late that Saturday afternoon at about 4 p.m. On to our return trip, this was supposed to be on April 27, which we planned as such, because my wife and I had work on Monday. We got to the airport in Lagos, two hours 20 minutes before takeoff, we checked-in, started going through the formalities, and when we were supposed to receive our boarding pass we were told that we were not on the flight list. That we had our ticket suspended because we missed the first leg of our flight, and in all the days and hours of communication, with Kenya Airways in New York, Nairobi and Lagos nobody told us they would be suspending our ticket. That we needed to call them for in their words “too see if there would have been anything they can do for us,” or just cancel our entire ticket for missing the first part of our trip.Even the booking agent’s cheap-o-Air was not informed by Kenya Airways and they did not inform us. We had to scramble, to get back as quickly as possible, calling some of our friends back in New York, to help us book a flight from there because we could not use our debit cards to book tickets from Lagos, Nigeria. All the while we had to call relatives to sleep at their place, because oblivious as usual Kenya Airways did not even give us a hotel to stay in or help out in any way. We went back and forth in Lagos, Nigeria, with Kenya airways officials in Lagos (who were not really helpful), their officials in Nairobi (who found it hard talking calls, and were almost useless), and their JFK manager (who found it hard contributing). We also spoke with the booking agents who sent it to their escalation team, while doing everything to try and resolve the situation, including trying to speak with the Kenya Airways staff in Lagos and Nairobi. They both said the only person who could do anything about it the JFK manager, who did not respond calls or emails. We eventually had success with an Emirates flight to New York. We heard from the Kenya Airways airline on Sunday evening, Dubai time, all they said was the error was regretted and that the return leg ticket should be re-issued to us at no cost. No mention of all the other expenses we have incurred from the start, till now, plus the lost time wages. Well over $10000 at this time, all the pain and trauma.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ec/a2/default-avatar-2020-3.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emekamikeo,Emeka Mike O wrote a review May 2019,Emeka Mike O,,1 contribution,2 helpful votes,New York City - Lagos,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r670776496-Kenya_Airways-World.html,An airline from hell,Date of travel: April 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We used Kenyan Airways to fly from Nairobi to Zanzibar for our Honeymoon. Our outward flight delayed by 1 hour due to technical issues. Staff were very friendly and professional during this time. Offered juices, tea & coffee along with croissant. Our return flight Sunday 28th April at 9:50am departure was not great. We arrived at airport as per the timeframe given by airline. When we arrived security asked why are we here so early, no staff to do check in yet!!
This was only the beginning of worst things to come?
At about 8:00am we were told the flight was cancelled, not once did we receive any communication by the airline. I found this very strange as we had received plenty of emails before we left Nairobi? And nothing since, It’s Tuesday today!!
Communication at the airport was very poor. First we were told there would be no flights today to Nairobi, then they came back to us that we got on a flight at 4:30pm with a different airline, eventually we were told we would be going to a local hotel. The hotel was the Golden Tulip in Stonetown, staff very friendly and professional. No food or refreshments we’re offered during our stay. We were picked up at the hotel at 1:00pm and our flight was at 4:30pm, not once were we offered any food or drinks, very poor.
Why was the flight cancelled? Why no communication? Does this airline understand customer service? Even their webpage is poor, it asks do you want to chat and I said yes, simple you would think. No as you need to be a member, so I tried to join, all you had to do was give your email address. Simple you would think. No email has been sent. So as a company if you cannot fix problems or communicate with your customers they will use other options to tell future customers be aware of poor service.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnrR8903LK,johnrR8903LK wrote a review Apr 2019,johnrR8903LK,"Melbourne, Australia",9 contributions,3 helpful votes,Nairobi - Zanzibar Island,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r670394217-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Flight to Zanzibar and Back,Date of travel: April 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"They ruined my vacation, I been saving for long to offer this present to my daughter but they turn everything to a nightmare. Both Expedia and Kenya Airways has been very unprofessional.   I refer to my trip which was scheduled on the 10th April 2019, I am intensely disappointed with this disastrous situation related to the service which we received  not only me and my daughter( special that was her first time) but also a group of passengers who were travelling the same day. Julia was travelling and she was very much excited to go to Paris. Firstly on the 10th we received an e-mail informing that the flight will be delayed however we decide to arrive at the airport as schedule in order to avoid any discomforts.  Upon check in I was very much anxious and I asked the Kenya Airport Rep. whether we shall be able to catch our next flight to Paris due to the flight delay. She reassured me that needful has been done in Kenya and everything will be going on smoothly Acoona matata she said to me looking at my little girl  Julia with a smile.   So we took the flight and Julia was so happy.  When we arrived in Kenya Airport we could see 2 Kenya Airways aeroplane still charging things I told my daughter that we shall probably be taking one of them.  We rushed straight to the transfer counter when reached there and asked the lady told us that the door is already closed  and that she will not be able to do anything for us then arrived the other passengers from our previous flght going to paris and also to other destinations which was in the same situation  .  Everyone could clearly see that there was nothing fishy going on and they finally mentioned that there was an overbooking situation. We were all panicking and especially me as I was in a country with my daughter with only strangers around I talking to them in English however they were talking between in a different languages which  I was not able to understand.  Finally we were advised that we have been booked on the next flight which was scheduled the next day at 23h00.  So we had no other choice than staying there.  They said that they booked us a hotel and was going to provide transfers but this was not simply at all without being offensive Kenya is not like Mauritius.   We waited long to get our luggage and were only able get them at round 02H00 and 2 of my suitcases were broken. Together with other passengers we had to walk out of the airport far away on the parking in order to van to go to the hotel without anyone from Kenya Airways to accompany us. The hotel was quite far from the airport and to our surprise some of us was booked at Tamarin Hotel which look much more secured that Weston where we stayed.  We were very uncomfortable and had no other choice than to stay inside the hotel until the evening Our pick up was at 20h00 in an old 50 seaters bus which was overcrowded and we had to stop to various security check point where we had to get out of the bus walk to security post and after get back in the bus.. Arriving at the airport we had to find out our way to the checkout points without any assistance.  Finally we left Kenya the next day arriving to Paris on the 12th April in the morning instead of the 11th April. Since the day I arrived to Paris, I spend my vacation contacting both Kenya Airways and Expedia USA (I purchased my tickets on line with Expedia) on and on.  I spend hours on Expedia Chat Customer service having each time to start over with a new person.  Expedia promised to come back to me but until today no one did.  I am extremely disappointed with both Expedia and Kenya Airways.  I even when to the office in Paris where I was told that I should deal directly with Expedia USA.  I also wrote to Kenya Airways but not a single response. Julia was so terrified and did not want to go back to Kenya.  So I wrote to both Expedia and Kenya  Airways to sort out things and to book me back on another flight but having got any reply from them I  booked another flight back to Mauriitus  Corsair airline which by the way was fantastic.  I definitely feel that I need to be compensated for everything.  This is totally inexcusable and impolite.

Nobody wanting to take responsibility and or to make the changed bookings. Lots of nightmare stories from fellow passengers.

"Good departure lounges and comfortable plane seats.
Having flown from London with a different airline that allowed 2 x checked in bags we were surprised that we were only allow one checked in bag as it was an internal flight even though travelling business class. We were told by the travel agent (in London) that two bags were allowed (for business class) but as we could not check in for this flight before we left London we did not have this confirmed by KQ. If the whole trip had been with Kenya Airways (International from London - Nairobi - Mombasa) we would have been allowed two checked in bags. We could not even pay for the extra bag and the only option given was to take the additional bags as cabin luggage which meant some quick re-packing at the check in desk.

1. Original flight KQ256 was canceled without a reason given.
2. The next flight KQ262 was suposed to leave at 22:45 but we did not leave till 1am. During this time we sat on a fairly warm plane with little information about what was going to happen.

"Took 4 flights in total (Mum - Nairobi, Nairobi - Cape Town, Johannesberg - Nairobi, Nairobi to Mumbai)
1. Old Aircrafts - not enough leg room, only 2 toilets for ~200 passengers
2. Less staff / stewards onboard for economy
3. One flight had no screens
4. Even the ones that have screens, may or may not work
5. The Joberg to Nairobi flight was Newer aircraft so was better than other 3 I experienced.
6. The Nairobi to Mumbai flight was horrible - the Aircon was either not working or not switched on, even after requesting repeatedly. It felt hot as hell. I could not take it anymore and yelled after 2 hours of enduring it and only after that felt some change in temperature - whew!
7. Don't expect anything from the staff. Even if you press the button, they take their own sweet time to come (since there are only 2 of them, I think it is understandable) and when they come, you ask for what you want, they may go back and forget bout it.

"Like the old addage of finding suitable property, Location, Location, Location, this should come as second nature to any service provider and one that KQ should be embracing.
Nairobi - Dar-Nairobi is a regular flight I take and I am a frequent flier on KQ. It is my airline of choice. What however is so frustrating is why ground staff don't tell people who have checked in on time and are waiting patiently at the gate, making in my case dinner plans to meet up by a certain time at my destination, that they are running late. An hour's delay ""only"" is LATE. It is just not good enough in this day and age that an airline that is competing at a global level should not improve on its customer experience outside the aircraft. One understands why a service might be running late but there is just no excusing the regular failing of telling passengers what is going on.......Come on KQ you are better than that.

"My first experience with KQ and the outward journey (AMS-NBO-LLW) was passable but not very recommendable !
1. despite an 8 hour layover in NBO, my suitcase still did not reach LLW on time (same with many other passengers !). I had to make a three hour journey back to the airport the following day to collect it. No offer from KQ to deliver it !

"I want to share my experience with Kenya Airlines.  I checked in 3 hours before my flight to Nairobi this January and when my flight landed in Nairobi by bag was not on the plane.  They told me it never made the flight and when it was delivered the next day, the bag was riffled through and a jacket was missing.  Neither the email address I had been given to contact the airlines or the two telephone numbers were in service to report the stolen items, so I tried to put in a claim two days later at the Nairobi Airport.  No one had any idea how I was to proceed in filing a claim for the missing jacket.  When I returned to the U.S. I found information on the website and after filling everything out I emailed my claim.  That would not do - I had to send it by mail to Nairobi, which I did along with the receipt for the jacket that was purchased especially for the safari.  I did receive a response that they would not pay for the full amount of the jacket, but agreed to 80% of the cost.  I agreed and signed the release which also had to be sent through the US Mail.  Once they received that they asked for my bank account number and routing information so they could deposit the amount into my account.  Instead I asked that they send me a check.  That was over a month ago and today I received an email saying Kenya Airways does not send out checks.  I called my banker and he said not to give them my bank number and routing information because of potential fraud.  Just wanted to give everyone a heads up - not only do their employees rifle through your luggage and help themselves, you won't be reimbursed without jumping through multiple hoops.  Probably because of the incredibly high unemployment rate in South Africa and Kenya, this wasn't my only experience of being ripped off.  This was my 3rd trip to Africa and will be my last.  I would have liked to have been reimbursed for my jacket, but not at the risk of falling prey to another scam involving my bank account.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/texlynn51,texlynn51 wrote a review Apr 2019,texlynn51,,5 contributions,25 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Nairobi,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r666796637-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Beware!,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"In spite of having confirmed flights, checking in well in advance & being issued boarding passes for our flights  with Kenya Airways we were not allowed to Baird our onward flight from Nairobi to Uganda. The first flight arrived in Nairobi pretty much on time for the connecting flight to Entebbe.  After queuing to board for 10 - 15 minutes we were told we could not board the flight which was clearly overbooked. We had to wait 7 hours for the next flight which left at 1:00am arriving in Uganda at 2:00am it was very hot & crowded at Nairobi airport. & it was a very uncomfortable wait. The meal supplied by the airline was small & miserly. Ground staff were extremely unhelpful. We arrived at our hotel in Kampala around 4:30 in the morning after a very unsafe drive in the dark.

Check in was swiftly and efficiently completed.
The departure gate was easily accessed straight from the departures area.
There was a delay on boarding and take off due to the late arrival of the pilot - we believe there had to be a change for domestic reasons but were never sure or explained to.

The Kenya airways was basically average the flight prices is on the lower side so if you pick this airline it is understandable that the service will not be of the same standard then some other airlines but this is a long flight and one would expect to get water on a more regular basis then what I did receive even when I pressed the assistance button there was no respond from any flight attendant.

No bag on arrival which contained my insulin in an iced container. Completed the necessary paperwork and was advised bag would likely arrive in the evening and if so would be delivered to hotel. Stressed the importance of getting the bag asap due to insulin. Proceeded to hotel in Entebbe a few minutes away. Contacted KQ in the morning and told bag had indeed arrived the evening before and would be delivered shortly. With no sign of the bag, made several connections with KQ who advised driver delivering bag had proceeded to Kampala first (an hour's drive away) to deliver delayed bags there and would come to hotel in Entebbe on the way back. What? Driver could not be contacted on his mobile. Eventually dispatched a taxi to Kampala to buy insulin (my brands not available in Entebbe). About to make purchase when bag arrived at hotel just before 6pm. Distressing experience. Flight crew friendly. Food on this KQ short haul consisted of a tiny bread roll! Is my experience unusual?

"Kenya airways advertises well and recently introduced new aircraft as well as a new business class hard product. Having spent 50% of my time on an aircraft over the past few years, I’m somewhat of a first hand on what to expect and Kenya Airways was thoroughly disappointing. On board cleanliness was abysmal as was the catering and service offered by the crew. I flew 4 sectors from Dubai via Nairobi onwards and back and I cannot say that I had one good flight.  There’s a reason why this airline is at the top when searching by price. You honestly get what you pay for. Lacklustre crew, poor food, a poor seat and an airport in Nairobi which is a joke for connecting passengers. I suggest you save your hard earned cash and pay a little more to travel on an alternative carrier - Ethiopian is excellent travelling to Africa. I would not choose to fly Kenya Airways again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/11/default-avatar-2020-41.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foodclipper,Rick wrote a review Apr 2019,Rick,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",23 contributions,2 helpful votes,Dubai - Nairobi,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r665690885-Kenya_Airways-World.html,"Good on paper and in the adverts but the reality is so different, beware!",Date of travel: February 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"It was a wonderful experience travelling with the Airline from the moment i stepped in the plane to disembarking.
The Crew were in hand to show the location of my seat and assuring me that in case i need anything i should just seek their attention. The way they conducted their briefing and the pilot introduction and smooth take off was amazing to me.
The inflight service was excellent and the Crew always asking if i need anything else.
Landing has always been my most adrenalin raising part though i even didin't realise how we came down from 39,000ft to the runway, i just noticed we have landed after i heard the jerking when we came to a stop.

We had looked forward to our once in a lifetime experience and traveling with Kenya Airways was primarily to keep the expenses down. Unfortunately the Air France and Kenya Airways aren’t cooperating in order to make any up selling of seats. Our son is tall with long legs therefore it would have been nice to buy the exit row seats. They wasn’t sold. I arranged that my son and daughter in law could move. But somebody else moved and placed himself in the middle seat.

"I recently flew on a 14 hr flight from JFK to Nairobi on Kenya airways dreamliners 787-8 in seat 20g. The configuration in economy is 3 seats, aisle, 3 seats, aisle, 3 seats. I could not believe how small the seat was and how little leg room I had. My knees touched the back of the seat in front of me. I am not a large person and felt so cramped and I had a seat on the aisle. The poor ladies also squished into our row had it just as bad. And this was a 14 hr flight!!!! When I got up to walk around I notice the seats in the middle configuration appeared to have more leg room and not only that there were empty seats! Why cram everyone on the side configuration?? This was the longest flight I have ever taken and in the smallest seat.  The movie selection was poor, same with the music selection.  The lights were turned out shortly into the flight so turning on my overhead light disrupted others trying to sleep. What a miserable long flight. The price to upgrade to business class was $1500 for this leg and since my total round trip ticket price was$777 it did not seem worth it.  But it was a truly torturous trip in economy so maybe it would have been worth it? Other reviews I read regarding business class on Kenya airways stated not worth it.

Why would one mislead your clients into believing that you will provide them with a scheduled service, when you have no ability to do so because you sell more tickets on a flight than you have available?
I have no idea. I know of no other industries that follow this practice. It seems to be unique to the airline industry.

"I know what most people will think, he probably eats too much... rest assured I don't. It was a code share with KLM through shcipol to London. And honestly Kenya airways needs to style up a little. If not for their own business for the sake of KLMs name. The flight was comfortable. The seats were good and the entertainment was fine. But you need to feed your passengers properly. I had a breakfast which was too little for a child to be honest. The lunch was chicken and I got 3 bite size pieces. If its snacks you're serving, make it known so we pre plan and est before we board. The staff were pleasant but felt like they had to be there rather than other airlines I've flown with where they want to be there. That's my two cents worth, hope you read this and improve.

"After 18.5 hours outbound delay I requested a flight change for my return as I thought the chance of missing my domestic flight was too high and it might be the latest back-but changing was too expensive so I was stuck on an airline which had such frequent delays Flightstats don`t track it.
So after boarding on time we spent the mandatory extra hour （apparently this is factored into times and they always expect to take an hour to do what reasonable airlines do preboarding）. Then we taxi to the runway, found that as they don`t maintain their fleet there are mechanical issues and go back to the terminal for repairs.
On arriving many hours late in Bangkok I'd requested colleagues book me a direct flight to Beijing-but was not allowed off the plane. One member of airport staff reconfirmed my domestic flight and eventually I found a member of airline staff who would let me use a hotspot-and told my colleagues to be on standby to help rearrange flights when I missed the one I'd been told I would make.

When we landed I was given a flight for the next day, and as I needed to get back asked my colleagues to buy a new flight-which with about one hour between disembarking one and takeoff on the other （for immigration, terminal change, checkin, security and boarding）I just made.
Hope to follow up for compensation-and with unvoluntary overnighters scheduled for both Outbound and return flights and postboarding repairs I cannot state more strongly to avoid this airline",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hillw00d,Hillw00d wrote a review Mar 2019,Hillw00d,"Tenbury Wells, United Kingdom",11 contributions,6 helpful votes,Nairobi - Guangzhou,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r658905668-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Unwanted overnights gurenteed,Date of travel: March 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

No extra refreshments
Then for the 1 hour scheduled stopover in Bangkok （which takes a minimum of almost 2 and gurentees a delay）you can't get off the plane as they clean and refuel.

"We traveled with Kenya Airways from Amsterdam to Mauritius.
We felt a bit disappointed with the Business class customer service especially after flying Singapore Airlines and Qatar Airways.
Service: the service was decidedly not up to standard. The stewardesses and stewards were very kind but not aware of the expectations of the customer who is paying an upgrade and hence have higher expectations. It was just like an economy plus service. We were offered no welcome aperitif before the diner...
It was a night flight and one hour before the time they serve breakfast, one of the stewardesses decided it was time to prepare breakfast. In so doing she made so much noise that, it was not possible anymore to enjoy the flatbed position! At the moment of the breakfast, the stewardess just skipped offering me a breakfast.

I’ve never been on such an uncomfortable plane. There was such little legroom that my knees were against the seat in front of me and I’m only 1.6 meters (5’3”). There was a metal bar where my feet were supposed to go. My seat didn’t recline because it was broken but the one in front of me did so the entertainment screen was so close to my face. The seats themselves offered no support. Think twice about saving money by spending 14+ hours onboard this torture chamber. The flight attendants were nice but never brought me what I asked for and the check in attendant was disinterested in her job.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/16/c2/83/36/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W812ZFjenniferl,Jennifer L wrote a review Mar 2019,Jennifer L,"Deerfield Beach, Florida",37 contributions,5 helpful votes,New York City - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r657933315-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Most uncomfortable plane ever,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I missed this flight due to my previous flight being delayed. When I arrived at the airport, It was still 45 minutes until the flight departed, but there was no customer service agent at the ticketing counter to assist me. I was forced to contact the online customer service, who offered me a seat on a plane 2 days later and $1000 more. Needless to say, I flew with another airline. Every since my flight, I have spoken with multiple customer service agents from Kenaya Airways on the phone, via chat, and I called the main office in Kenya. All these agents were unable to explain to me why the website, says I'm entitled to taxes and other fees to be refunded. Instead what I was told, is that I am a liar, and that the website is wrong.

I picked this airline, because the prices were good, but if something doesn't go according to plan, this airline will not assist you in any way or honor their own policies.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f6/0d/default-avatar-2020-34.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Relliott1217,Relliott1217 wrote a review Mar 2019,Relliott1217,,11 contributions,4 helpful votes,New York City - Entebbe,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r657933302-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Customer Service Will Not Help You!,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I had an absolutely terrible trip this past December. They run this airline like a commuter omnibus or worse. I was so happy to find out there was a new flight from JFK straight to Nairobi. Tickets were a bit cheaper than Emirates but I later regretted trying to saving that couple hundred bucks. First of all, the flight attendants especially the women were rude and moody! I couldn’t stop comparing with Emirates the whole time. Secondly the food was the worst ever! The only thing I like was some chicken sandwich. We would go for hours without a meal service and at one point I wished if there was a vending machine on board, I was starving. Last but not least, it was soooo cold on the plane like freezing and the blankets were supperrrr thin. I couldn’t believe it.

We then try to change our tickets and oh lawdy.... never seen anything like it. It was daylight robbery. If you go on the website or app it quoted you $400 and then when you try to pay you would get all sorts or error messages. I probably tried more than 20 times so I really think they were tampering with the online system. We then ended up calling and that’s when the real nightmare began. We probably talked to 10 different agents and they were all quoting us ridiculous fares like more than what we paid the round trip. They hung up on me more than 5 times and they would give you a weird ass long name when you asked. There is something shady going on with those change fares. I ended up buying a new ticket with emirates for 800 compared to the 1,700 Kenyan wanted to make me pay. Funny thing also is with Emirates you only pay $70 change fee and fare difference which there is usually hardly any. GO EMIRATES, BOO KENYAN!!! I’m going to report this airline to FAA or whoever can help stop this robbery. Maybe they should just operate domestically.

"The airline changed our 1st flight from Entebbe to Nairobi  to an hour earlier without proper warning. We were lucky to figure this out as we would have missed the flight altogether plus our next legs to NY and then Phoenix.The JFK flight left at 2300 hours and I decided to forgo dinner due to the lateness of the hour and get some sleep.  When I asked for breakfast at 0700 Kenya time, I was told that breakfast would be served NY time - 6 hours later.  After explaining that I was really hungry, not having eaten since lunch the day before (and Nairobi is such a chaotic airport that we never had time to get any food), they very reluctantly provided a dry bun and fruit.  But complained that they did not want to set a precedent for other passengers.  The general attitude was surly and they all did their best to never have any interaction with passengers.  Just trying to get a bottle of water seemed to be a problem. Not impressed at all and will never fly with them again.

"Firstly, my overall experience with Kenya Airways has been a grave disappointment. I've yet to complete my return journey and hope there is room for improvement. Nevertheless, yesterday was a horrible start for me (being my first experience with KQ in 2018). I was under the impression due to increased capacity in flying to internationally, include the United States, I will be able to begin accumulating mileage with Kenya Airways, but I was sadly mistaken. The message above, was the initial complaint in December. Over the past two months I've had continuous written debate/dialogue with the airline and their ""resolution"" is 3000 miles or $100 voucher for the same airline. Without considering all of the losses I incurred during this trip. My multiple destination ticket is as follows: depart 10/12 Juba, SS to Kigali, Rwanda (transit in Nairobi), depart 14/12 Kigali, Rwanda to Nairobi (transit in Burundi), and 16/12 Nairobi to Juba, SS. Upon the first flight from Juba, there was an hour delay; as I began to notice the allotted time left, I immediately approached Kenya Airways staff, expressing my concerns. Since the flight to Kigali was 6:30 PM and due to the delay, I would arrive in Nairobi shortly before the Kigali flight departure. Their response, reflected the ability for me to join the 9PM flight by Rwandair, but the system was not allowing them to make the changes from Juba. Therefore I was recommended to immediately approach the help/transfer desk in Nairobi. As optimistic as I remained throughout my flight to Nairobi, my hopes were completely shattered. The rep (unfortunately, I don't recall her name) informed me the next available flight will be Tuesday, 11 December at 7AM. I insisted the rep make a stronger effort to grant me a seat on the Rwandair flight, due to my pending appointments/hotel bookings in Kigali. I even offered to pay a fare difference (even if the only seat available was in Business class; I will pay), but I was unsuccessful. I exclaimed, my medical condition (epilepsy) will be triggered since I failed to put enough medication in my carry on bag, but again was told I will not be able to receive my checked in bag. She offered to place me in a hotel and a free transit visa. I expressed my hotel in Kigali has been paid for and I will not be able to receive a refund, due to this occurrence, but the rep presented no comforting suggestions. Though, I continued to inform the rep, I have a doctor's appointment in Kigali (the main purpose of my short visit-1st time to the city), but she was unable to ease my concerns. Moving forward, I was sent to the rep responsible for issuing the hotel voucher. I insisted the pick-up be at 4:30, but he stated 4 AM is the most appropriate. Being a non-Kenyan; unfamiliar with the main attractions/distance from airport locations, I was placed in a hotel chosen by Kenya Airways. Unknowingly, the hotel was 40 mins away from the airport. I arrived in Nairobi at 6:30 and didn't arrive to the hotel until 8:50 PM. Nairobi was cold and rainy; in which I was highly unprepared for such temperatures causing great distress to my physical state. As an airline highly aware of Nairobi's traffic, I would assume if seeking the best interest of the client, the hotel placement would be fairly closer to airport to avoid any delays, etc. Again, it proved Kenya Airways to be highly insensitive towards the customers. To add insult to injury:•             Since I didn't have enough medication, to prevent a seizure I will have to remain distracted and awake (seizures happen while I'm asleep)•             Without access to my checked in bag, I was unable to shower and struggled to brush my teeth until I borrowed from another hotel guest.•             We were collected from the hotel at 4:15 AM, in the rain; during checkpoint all of the passengers had to disembark from the shuttle bus (in the cold and heavy rain, which I did not have on appropriate attire).•             Upon arrival at the airport, we were dropped much further from the departures' entrance, causing me to run under the rain again.Due to the change of flight, I was unable to see the doctor as planned today. I plan to do a ""walk-in"" tomorrow, with the hope to receive an opening (which is unpredictable). My four nights trip was shortened to 3 nights and I pray I'm able to receive my medical check-up as planned. This detailed message is written to express the series of events, which has occurred in the last 24 hours. Since, the airport was unable to provide sufficient support nor compensation, I hope this online customer relations is willing to assist in addressing my concerns, struggles and much more which can never be repaid by the airline. Nevertheless, I expect Kenya Airways to display a sense of emotion and care for their client, through a compensation of sorts.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/81/default-avatar-2020-43.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/unmiss_juba,W.

"Currently sitting (still) on the stairs of the Nairobian airport while typing my review about our trip with Kenya Airways. Our journey started at Cape Town International Airport where our flight left with a delay of five hours heading to Nairobi. Due to our delay which was marked by almost no communication/miscommunication by the crew and the grounded staff we couldn´t manage to get our connecting flight to Zanzibar. Throughout our journey, they managed to maintain an almost ridiculously low level in customer service which seems to affect all levels from normal staff up to supervisor and manager. Corporate Identity but for sure in the worst way possible.There was no sign at all that the airline staff tried to find solutions for the upcoming problems. However, when we were based in Nairobi we were heading to their so-called ""pride of Africa"" lounge which was actually a very nice place to stay if you are able to afford the extra fee that is required. In the meantime, we were re-booked on the following flight heading to Zanzibar with a scheduled departure at 00:15 a.m. Meant a total waiting time of 24+ hours. We were confident that everything would be alright with our re-booked flight cause the departure Terminals in the lounge didn´t tell any difference. When we arrived at our departure gate there was already a crowd of people screaming, causing and folding their hands over their heads in disbelief. FLIGHT CANCELLED!!!! (as we found out later for many of the passengers, not for the first time) We thought it couldn´t get any better until we heard one of the plenty of explanations that the grounded personal had to offer why the flight was actually cancelled. Due to her saying there is a strike at the moment and there was already a very high percentage that this flight could be cancelled. She continued that the possibility was known to them for two days. At this point, I would like to stop with my remarks. I hope I was able to express my feelings towards Kenya airways in an objective and helpful way for people who think about travelling with the airline. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend it at all more so I would advise you to avoid it! To conclude my statements I want to add that mistakes can happen at all time and in any way. It is that time when a human being, company what so ever is tested to see if their status quo can stand the surroundings. Kenya Airways failed at all levels. They should go back the drawing boards and start from the bottom down so that their slogan ""pride of Africa"" can either be fulfilled with life or be just another slogan that is not worth the paper it's written on.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marco09091990,Marco P. wrote a review Mar 2019,Marco P.,,1 contribution,4 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Zanzibar Island,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r657077524-Kenya_Airways-World.html,"""Horror""",Date of travel: March 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I am totally outraged with the treatment of this company and the lack of professionalism. They broke up my luggage more than 50 days ago and still didn't give me a solution. The truth is that the baggage service is a shame from both NBO and JNB. I do not recommend this airline to anyone.

"We are frequent travelers to and from East Africa and have been on several carriers-- typically KLM, but also British Airways, Emirates and Qatar.  Locally we frequently fly Kenya Airways and I have always been very pleased with their service.  We tried this flight since the price point was better than others and the direct flight was appealing.  To me the ground service (check in, security) was outstanding and better than other carriers.  I did have to call about some ticket issues and reached a live person almost immediately on the phone.  However, I agree the in-flight service was suboptimal as they only pass by during meal times.  On our return flight they had cups of water and juice as well as some snacks in the back of the plane which was an improvement over the way there when I was begging for water for myself and my family repeatedly.  Also the food was better on the return flight (NBO--NYC), probably since it had been sourced in Kenya.  HOWEVER, the turbulence on the way back was simply terrifying.  Was it a bad day?  Is it always like that because of the route?  I do not like to consider what funeral plans my family might make for me while I am at 40,000 feet.  My spouse said that the turbulence alone was enough for us to pay the extra $$ for a different carrier.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reddy009,Reddy009 wrote a review Mar 2019,Reddy009,,2 contributions,,New York City - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r656744254-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Turburlence was scary - otherwise I was pleased,Date of travel: March 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Whilst flying with Kenya Airways doesn’t differ much from other airlines, their customer service is despicable. So if, like me, you find your bag missing at your destination airport expect nothing done about it for days followed by a bunch of lies and blame pushing onto someone else. If they bother to reply to any message you might send them, it will be a scripted message that may as well be automated. Nobody has a clue what is going on and all they keep doing is telling you to wait. It’s been 5 days now and they still don’t know where my bag is and I am supposed to be just patient whilst all my belongings are not with me, in a very hot country where you need to change your clothes all the time.

- Seat and comfort: Better than most United flights. Enough wiggle room. Personal TVs on each seat, and they had classic cartoons like Anamaniacs and Captain Planet! :D Why don't more airlines do that!

- Food: Decent options even for a vegan. Not just boring steamed vegetables. Portions could have been a bit larger, but they welcome you to come to them if you're still hungry and they will do something for you.

"KQ is a different cattle of fish when flying in a Boing 787-8. This aircraft was used for my Nairobi to Johannesburg leg. So much better then almost 6h in a 737-800.
Seat and space is great, such a pleasure actually versus the other flight. However if you look for frills, bells and whistles, not hear its functional, easy to use has plug point, USB point. The seat padding could be renewed as the seat covering material is dated. Otherwise great.
Window shades are per pushbutton and whilst the cabin was relatively new, it had not been cleaned properly from the previous le of this aircraft.
The service was so, so only 8 passenger in the business class section thus a boring leg for the crew and sitting in 1J made me listed to a lot and vocal conversation throughout the flight. See picture.
Drinks were offered but sans the bow of nuts, the menu style as simple and straight forward as in my previous experience but the food was tasting that much better and the beef stew was brilliant.
Otherwise an eventful flight and my take is that the business class of KQ is a no frill business class which makes a lot of sense to me reflecting in the price and if KQ would be using the same aircraft style on the Mumbai to Nairobi leg, I may say good bye to the middle eastern airline have relative comfort and safe quite a bit of money.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/08/d4/eb/5c/chris-p.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/496ChrisP,Chris P wrote a review Feb 2019,Chris P,"Bengaluru, India",144 contributions,66 helpful votes,Nairobi - Johannesburg,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r652726654-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Pride of Africa,Date of travel: February 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

KQ became my choice of airline flying from Mumbai to Johannesburg via Nairobi on the 5th of Feb 2019. The price for business class was most attractive so much so that I took into account that the longest leg of my Journey - Mumbai to Nairobi was in a 737-800 for 5h40.
Whilst the check in was fast and efficient, there was not a person from Kenya Airways available, as I wanted to change my booking thus I was stuck.
The lounge facilities KQ is using in Mumbai is great and adequate.
Boarding was done according to row and it took some time, via an airbridge with business class passengers boarding last.
The aircraft was newish too but the seats well sat in the leg rest simply unless as only coming up ½ way letting the legs hang in midair, so just no use.
Friendly cabin crew dished out hot towels and pre take off drinks did not include Champagne or sparkling wine.
After take off drinks service included a beautiful South African Red Wine, which I had together with a bowl of nuts.
Food service was ½ way into the flight, the menu had choices all straight forward and simple not tasting as great as the food which I had from Nairobi to Johannesburg. No frills, if you are used to a substantial dinner, eat before the flight. The so called Waldorf salad had no celery in it, i.e. just apple and Walnut in a vegetarian Mayonnaise. Chicken was dry dessert OK rounded up with a great cup of Kenyan Tea.
I did not use the entertainment system, but saw from other passengers that it was working well.
It was a bit stressful sitting in such a confined space for almost 6 hours. However flight was on time and all was good.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/08/d4/eb/5c/chris-p.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/496ChrisP,Chris P wrote a review Feb 2019,Chris P,"Bengaluru, India",144 contributions,66 helpful votes,Mumbai - Nairobi,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r652723511-Kenya_Airways-World.html,How I enjoyed the Pride of Africa!,Date of travel: February 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Me and my boyfriend went meant to fly to Malawi last September, but my boyfriend died in July, so we obviously never took that trip. I have been trying since September to get a refund on the tickets with Kenya Airways, and specifically told them about 100 times NOT to pay the refund on my boyfriend’s card, as he is dead and I do not have access to his accounts. They always took weeks and weeks to get back to me after any of my emails, and I never got to speak to the same person.

"We were travelling from Kenya to Cape Town in business class on 16/11/2018 and on arrival in Cape Town found that our sat nav had been stolen from our hold luggage. A sat nav is essential for driving in SA as we were driving 2500 miles. Therefore we had to hire one at £6 per day for 21 days and replace it once back in the UK.

The response from Kenya Airways was awful. Slow response to my emails informing them of the issue initially but on our return to the UK they asked for all information regarding how much the sat nav cost etc. Digging this out was not a quick process. 4 weeks later I got a response saying that that no compensation was going to be paid, basically hiding behind terms and conditions. Clearly they view theft as just one of those things and is covered by terms and conditions.

"The service was better than expected. The only complaint was during the departure outward to Kenya. I am passenger who requires special assistance and unfortunately it was not provided until the time of the flight. Despite several reminders and requests, the special services failed. I am not sure whether it’s the Airlines responsibility or the Airport’s but it was very frustrating as there was no time allowed for either refreshments or duty free shopping. Inflight services were not too bad. The other problem was the connection flights from Nairobi to Mombasa. It’s a big big hurdle to pick up luggage and re-checkin. If the tickets was booked from London to Mombasa, then I would have expected it Kenya Airways to transfer the luggage directly rather than having to go through security and re-checkin. Very frustrating. The other problem encountered on inflight was the limited variety of soft drinks. No ginger ale available. No sprite.

And i love it,especially their night flights(they do tend to take extra care for their customers on night flights than day flights)!

I used to think,that using electronics is not allowed on most KQ flights especially between countries close to Kenya and domestic??? And every flight i have taken with KQ,i hear the Captain announcing it as so!!

However,i have noticed that quite a good number of flyers keep phones on through out the whole leg-from the time they strap their seatbelts,to the time they unfasten them to disembark!
Now,i know how stubborn flyers can be,but an extra eye by the crew would be nice,to ensure electronics are off/not used,atleast take off and touchdown!??

On email and Twitter, all they said was someone will contact us. No one wrote back or called. I have written to their CEO Today, let's hope this makes them act.

Nonetheless, after this experience, be rest assured, neither would I travel with them again nor will I recommend this airline (supposedly the pride of Africa) to anyone again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdityaN383,Aditya N wrote a review Jan 2019,Aditya N,"New Delhi, India",66 contributions,5 helpful votes,Zanzibar Island - New Delhi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r648244644-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Pathetic customer service,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I travelled with Kenya Airways from Dar-Accra. Much has been done from online booking/check-in, transit in Nairobi and inflight meals. However, KQ you need to change old plane flying to Accra, Freetown to Monrovia too old for the long trip (with numerous stop over).

"The recently established route between New York and Nairobi with Kenya Airways was a great news for someone who has to travel often to Africa for work. However, for a 14 hours flight flying business you expect full comfort and that is not what I got.
I understand that Kenya Airways has just started the route and has to use a smaller plane than other intercontinental flights (most of the seats were empty) which then translate in seats that do not extend to a flat bed nor one with enough room leg when laying down. It also shakes more when hitting turbulence than a bigger plane would and that is a big minus for an anxious flyer as I am.
The food and snacks were very average for that class of service and I thought that the movie selection was rather poor, with only very few recent movies to opt from... I am not sure what I will be watching on my way back. The staff on board were very kind and attentive and that was the highlight of the trip.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/16/e8/92/87/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ulpio,ulpio wrote a review Jan 2019,ulpio,"Brooklyn, New York",140 contributions,61 helpful votes,New York City - Entebbe,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r648084385-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Below expectations,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Overall Kenya Airways is fine and a great direct flight option to African locations from the US.  However, here are some observations for future travelers to be prepared and some takeaways from a customer experience for the airline.The connection process returning to the US from other African cities via Nairobi needs work.  Due to their flight schedule I had a 50 min layover in Nairobi.  My departing flight from Kigali thankfully left on time however, the ticket agent could not print out a boarding pass for the Nairobi to NYC leg of the trip.  This meant after landing in Nairobi I, along with many other passengers had to wait in line and have a boarding pass printed.  This seemed like a unnecessary step creating more work for the airline and stress for the customer who already has a short connection time.  Add to that deplaning in Nairobi meant getting on a shuttlebus to the terminal, filling out a health form, passing through 2 levels of security and you start to get the picture.  We made the flight and the staff was helpful in getting everyone shuttled through their process but if you look at their on time departure record you will see the flight from Nairobi to JFK is always late.  You can see why...they are holding the flight for all the incoming transfers to go through their process which is longer and more stressful than needed.  Also this left no time for grabbing a snack or water for the 15 hour journey ahead. Also be sure to load up your ipad with movies.  The inflight options are not as extensive as other airlines and the choices are the same both eastbound and westbound.  For a 15 hour flight this needs improvement.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/eb/default-avatar-2020-27.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jgtraveler2016,jgtraveler2016 wrote a review Jan 2019,jgtraveler2016,"Boston, Massachusetts",2 contributions,2 helpful votes,New York City - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r647605191-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Still have kinks to work out on new NYC-Nairobi route,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Should've know when it took staff almost an hour to check us in at JFK (we had booked months in advance, did not have any extra luggage and no passport problems). Our flight was from NYC to Nairobi then an a connecting flight to Tanzania. So to make a dreadful long story a little shorter:

In NYC a one hour check-in. Were assured we were checked in on our connecting flight.
Interesting note-everything seems to be done via cell phone, a conspicuous lack of booking/checking done via computer.

Got to Nairobi where we were told our ongoing flight had been cancelled. They offered to put three of the four of us on a wait list and suggested our school aged daughter stay overnight in Nairobi! When asked if one of the parents could ""swap out"" and stay -told ""no, it's in the computer"" (again very odd non-use of technology)

After several hours, we were re-reouted to Dar es Salaam then to Kilimanjaro airport-for a two hour ride to our hotel. Oh and our luggage did not make it along this complicated flight path. All in about a day and a half wasted (we were meeting a safari company in Tanzania)

At each step of this journey we were told everything was ""sorted out"" our luggage would ""definitely"" arrive with us etc., etc., etc.

"I set out in JFK to find my gate. Checking the kiosks along my route to the air trains for gate and other information, I encountered the following messages in this order.....1) my flight was cancelled 2) no longer cancelled but an hour behind 3) on time 4) boarding. (An hour and a half early!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was told by the gentlemen I was seated between.)
As you can tell, it was difficult to understand what to do, so I began to run through the massive airport in case boarding was the last change being made. Unfortunately, after running so fast, the first thing I discovered was that everyone has vacated their posts due to the newest update. (Offering no explanation to those of us who were arriving on time) The guard did let me through since I already had a boarding pass, but after negotiating security at break neck speed I still had to go to the very last gate in this section of the airport. When I arrived, almost an hour ahead of when boarding was supposed to begin, the attendants would not even look at me until I forced them to, and refused to open door though the plane was clearly sitting there. After I convinced them to open the door they told me everything was fine, and they had my luggage. When I arrived in Entebbe, my luggage had been lost. This was a direct flight from jfk to entebbe. This tells me they did not take care of my luggage as they said. I cannot fathom a universe in which it would be legal, right, good, helpful, honest, or ok, for lack of a better way to describe it, in which people arrive on time to discover their pilot decided to leave early. What in the world? Moreover those poor people had been sitting in the plane that whole time so what good was boarding early in the first place????? It was a very close call and a terrible experience. They were not apologetic, helpful until forced to be, or nice. Once I boarded the plane, somehow I lost my window seat and was placed in the middle isle in the middle seat between two large men. They treated me as if I had been the offending party. Then on the next KA flight, out of Nairobi , one of the attendants hit me HARD on my arm when I was resting and yelled at me to lift my shade?!?!?!?!?!?! In what world can attendants hit you and yell at you to lift your shade? Why must our shades be up in the first place as we fly along in the sky??????No explanation. Sadly, this is the only flight of its kind, so I’m stuck using a more challenging route. Honestly, it will be worth it to go through Europe or Turkey not to experience that sort of situation again. I’m hopeful that better staffed and trained attendants will come on board and that Kenya Airways will take heed all of their bad reviews to heart. They could truly be so much more with such little effort.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HSBKU,HSBKU wrote a review Jan 2019,HSBKU,,3 contributions,2 helpful votes,New York City - Entebbe,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r646595056-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Departure,Date of travel: January 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Someone called me out for being unpatrotic. I fly frequently but never on the national carrier. I had not flown Kenya Airways in a while, due its terrible service- ground and flight attendants. For some reason, KQ staff think they are doing you a big favour serving you. They are the most indifferent and unfriendfly airline staff. I could go on and on about the food and state of toilets etc. However for me the worst experience was having to drag my 3 suitcases across the parking lot in the rain from the international to domestic flight terminal and had to go through security check once again. I had made inquiries while booking the flight and I was assured that I would find my luggage at my final destination - Mombasa.

"We were holidaying in Zanzibar at the end of a work contract in Kenya. I thought that I would treat the family to a business class return to Nairobi.
At about 8.30PM then night before our flight was scheduled I received a series of emails saying that our flight had been cancelled and we had been rescheduled to a later flight.
The later flight was going to cause us to miss our connection back to Australia so after a couple of very tense couple of hours and more than a dozen phone calls we got rescheduled onto an earlier flight at 3.40AM.
As a result we had to leave our Zanzibar accommodation immediately, forfeiting a night's fees, we had to pay an additional US$70 for the midnight transfer to the airport.
On the flight there was no food and beverage service and before leaving the airport we were denied access into the business class lounge.
On arrival back in Australia I lodged a claim for a refund of the upgrade as we hadn't received business class service.
A month later, with several followups Kenya Airways is claiming that they can't access the tickets to process a claim because they have been used.
What a scam - charge customers for an upgrade then cancel the flight causing them disruption to their holiday and additional expense. Don't provide the upgrade service that has been paid for and then claim that the system won't allow access to assess or process a refund claim.
As a side note the aeroplane that we travelled on was filthy and stunk!

"Outwards- I upgraded to Business Class. I paid an extra £800 for an upgrade which to have a reclining seat overnight was worth it to me. This was my 1st upgrade experience so I have no comparisons. The seat itself backed onto economy where there were several young children & a baby who were unsettled & cried for a lot of the flight. I have learnt from this mistake now! Once my earplugs were in place, the experience improved. Flight attendants were attentive. The seat was very comfortable plenty of drinks were served & the food was excellent. See photos of 1st class food. No complaints, but I do have no comparable experiences in upgrades..I would happily travel business class with Kenyan Airways again.

My return flight was daytime economy. A completely different experience. The obvious difference in seats, but the food was awful and I am not a fussy eater. Drinks were fine, but the meal itself was dreadful & tasteless. I was hungry during the 9 hour flight. The airhostess accidentally managed to knock my arm when passing with the trolley as I was drinking my coffee with the result that I was covered in it for most of the flight. Unpleasant.

"TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN,

I am writing to you as a very displeased/disgruntled Customer, i flew KQ on Dec27th from Dubai on Sky-Priority after upgrade & IT WAS A DISASTER, when i was checking in the Lady at the check-in counter In Dubai confirmed i will receive my baggage in Mombasa, at NO point was i told that i will need to go fetch my luggage from the belt & drag it by myself to terminal 1D. On this flight no breakfast was served or Menus provided till i requested for before landing_ this isn't my Job, it should come automatically without a client having to ask for it. On arrival in Nairobi i proceeded straight for my Mombasa flight which was VIA Jambojet where i met a Rude & uncouth server. When i asked her if my luggage was on board her response was totally out of line how do you tell a client you can go fetch your bags from where you come from, at this point i was outraged as my flight was departing at 9:40, well i missed the flight as i had to go & fetch my bags, and so you are aware the Server wasn't remorseful at All, i reported this incident to the JKIA KQ Offices & Mombasa Office too on the 27th but for Sure it was never reported.

My flight was slated for the 4th of January back to Dubai, on the 3rd KQ confirmed my upgrade Status and & my Credit-card was charged, on the 4th of January i decided to take the 540 out of Mombasa instead of flying with KQ_ I wasn't going to go through another experience of having my bags left behind, upon reaching Nairobi an hour later i proceeded to check in for my business flight but since i had missed my Mombasa flight they couldn't see the booking, i understand that at this point they should have charged me for NO SHOW PENALTY But they proceeded to tell me that We are Sorry Mr.Mutava we cannot see your booking so please call your Travel agent? I couldn't believe what i was hearing, as in im in Kenya you need me to call my Travel agent who will take time to re-book me instead of you finding a solution right their, i asked to speak to a manager but no 1 seemed responsive to call 1. As this was escalating the lady at the KQ offices that morning told me that the only available option was to pay 980$ (Parting with this sum of money & you hadn't planned for is unfair) to fly on business, i already told her that have i a confirmed ticket why wouldn't she Penalize me for the NO show & let me proceed, no explanation was given, at this point i was tired & needed to get on my flight & come see my Family, on the flight back to Dubai 1 of the flight Attendants on Business was Francis,his attention to detail and most of all his smile was utterly impeccable, he oozed of proper etiquette & Customer Care know how, you Francis are a Star & we need more like you, so yes not all was bad i will give credit where its due.

I am not looking for freebies but you have to understand that the Slogan you bear carries Weight as you are a National Airline & to receive Such services its uncalled for, if your Staff cannot handle the pressure Of the Airline Sector then you will loose numbers with time. For Sure you have lost me as a client, i may be just 1 person but revenue is revenue & it keeps you running it doesn't matter which Cabin i flew what matters is that you hold your end of the bargain and get me the right Services. Let your staff know that you Should be able to maintain Consistency on all Levels & be able to resolve complaints amicably.

Flew from London to Mauritius with a stopover in Nairobi. The dreamliner flight from London was very comfortable and pleasant. The Embraer flight from Nairobi to Mauritius was also fine. Service was good  and specific orders for food were fulfilled and good. On the return flight there was an hours delay but that was due to adverse weather. Have used KA several times now and the service and comfort is as good as any other major airline including BA.

Old aircrafts (the arm rest was almost coming off on the return flight from Cape Town) - some of which dont have personalised entertainment screens or the crew doesnt offer headphones.

"Book this airline with caution, especially if there are big dollars at stake.    We booked full-fare first class tickets months in advance when all seats were open.  When we arrived at the airport, the staff informed us we were flying in coach!     We pleaded for the seats we purchased for almost $ 4,000 and asked for an explanation.  We were told ""the computer makes the decisions.:""We were promised a refund of some sort and were given a paper form to complete.  It was our only option as no manager with authority was available to resolve.    These forms were plentiful at the hub, so we assume customers are denied seats often.  In the five months since this incident, we competed the form several times via paper, email and link and have had no reply.   Finally, I started posting on Facebook daily and got limited response with our names misspelled and the offer of a voucher.  Bottom line:   We suspect this carrier routinely charges for first class, puts customers in coach and pockets the difference.

"KQ Dreamliner was long awaited and so welcomed when it arrived but am I the only passenger to find it extremely uncomfortable. The only benefit I see is the big window. I dont know if KQ went for the cheapest upholstery available but I find the seats the most uncomfortable I have ever flown. What is all the hype about? Have KQ let us down?

Within an hour my back is aching and I have nowhere to put my legs and, God forbid, if the passenger in front reclines his seat, you find you are headbutting the TV screen every time you want to eat the food they serve.

8th January 2019 was auspicious, i guess for all the wrong reasons. We boarded on time and closed the doors, 100% full, on time. But then Traffic Control advised of the drone at Heathrow which had caused the runway to be closed and delayed our departure. Not KQ's fault by any means and neither was the update of information. We finally departed, with an already aching back, 90 minutes later and arrived in NBO about 45 minutes later having been served a very average dinner of bean salad, spicy chicken and boiled rice and cheesecake for dinner and a truly awful box of croissant and coco chip cookie for breakfast that tasted about one week old.

Service on KQ these days has become very variable ranging from amazingly good to amazingly bad, often at the whim of the flight crews and, more often than not, its the female crew members who seems to be the least helpful. But not always. On this flight, just one of the ladies seemed to wish she was someplace else (so did we) but the remainder provided an average to well above average level of service.

Nairobi ground crews were helpful, especially at 6am when JKIA is bursting at the seams on a daily basis. One of our onward flights was cancelled but a slightly later flight had the reservation already confirmed. Kigali flight boarded early and left 10 minutes early, was served a single slightly fresher croissant for breakfast by very friendly flight crews and arrived in good time.

As always, Kigali ground crews were efficient and friendly.

So would I fly KQ again? I am not really sure. Short haul for sure but long haul has so many alternative options that have more comfortable seats, better food and better service that the decision needs careful consideration.

"OK, so I always read flight reviews and think people just like complaining for the sake of it. But my experience with Kenya Airways was just so disappointing that I have to write a review.

I was set to fly from Cape Town Intl. At 23.00 on 21 December to Amsterdam via Nairobi, with a 2h20min layover. So...

(1) KA continuously emails you suggesting you upgrade your seat to business class but can't email you to let you know that your flight has been delayed. I only found out because I decided to Google, as KA already seemed to have a bad reputation and I wanted to make sure.

(2) arrived at the airport on time, none of the staff could give me any information about the flight or whether I would actually make my connecting flight. The first flight was delayed 2 hours to 1AM with boarding staring at 00.20. While waiting I decided to do some googling. Turns out the reason our flight was delayed was because the incoming flight from Nairobi had been delayed. This flight was meant to land in Cape Town at 00.45. So tell me, how are we supposed to board at 00.20 when the other flight is only landing 25 min later? Eventually they updated the departure to 1.30am. We only left at 2am. I understand that flights get delayed, but what irritated the hell out of me was that I watched them vacuum the plane for at least 20min while we were waiting to board. I'm pretty sure most people wouldn't care about a slightly dirty plane if it means getting to your destination on time.

(3) when we boarded the plane I asked the flight attendants about my connecting flight. They too could not give me any information. I asked whether the pilots would be able to keep us informed. No. No help at all. No information. Nothing. We would have to wait til we land in Nairobi. It being 2am I went straight to sleep and skipped the meal. When I woke up around 5 or 6 I was pretty hungry so I called an attendant and asked if I could please have a snack, like a packet of nuts or something. ""we've already served the meals"" she said rudely. ""I know, I just want like a packet of nuts or something"". Off she went in a huff. Like geez, it's just a packet of nuts.

(4) we landed in Nairobi at 8am, I saw my connecting flight being pushed out as we were coming in. I'm not sure why they didn't hold the flight. Getting off, it became apparent that there were around 40 of us who had missed the flight. So instead of trying to get us on the flight they ended up sending us all to a hotel for the day to wait for the next flight, at midnight. The hotel was nice and everything but I had already made a nonrefundable booking for a hotel in Amsterdam, which I obviously lost out on.

(5) finally arrived in Amsterdam 36 hours later, only to find that the airline had left one of my bags in Nairobi and the other one was beaten to a pulp.

I honestly will never fly with Kenya Airways again and will definitely not recommend it. It was just a completely horrendous experience.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/5a/default-avatar-2020-36.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meghanhaupt91,Meghan H wrote a review Jan 2019,Meghan H,"Hermanus, South Africa",4 contributions,1 helpful vote,Cape Town Central - Amsterdam,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r644693685-Kenya_Airways-World.html,"Kenya Airways, not the pride of Africa.",Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Flying from Dubai to Dar es Salaam via Nairobi and back, or four flights in total. All flights were delayed so much that we missed our connection every single time, meaning that we had to spend an unplanned night in DAR on our way out and in NBO on our way back. This also meant we (almost) missed half of our holiday, because we missed our connection to our island (and all flights were booked till a few days later).

"My flight was JFK - Cape Town with layover in Nairobi then back to JFK from Johannesburg with layover in Nairobi.  Our Dec 19th original flight was changed by Kenya which resulted in a 5 yr layover from a 2 hour layover.  When we arrived we learned the connecting flight had issues so our layover was now 9 hours.  Prior to my departure I emailed Kenya explaining the long layover created by them and requested complimentary lounge passes for me & my guest - which was approved.  Upon arriving at the Kenya lounge in Nairobi we were asked to wait while the ladies at reception seeked information on this request.  I had the actually email in my hand giving approval, yet they didn't care what it said..  They made us wait for over an hour in the lobby, only to come back and say that Customer Service Rep I corresponded with never completed the transaction by requesting management approval from that location, therefor we needed to leave or pay the $45 fee to stay.  We ended up paying out of frustration but voiced our negative experience.  The employees at the lounge could care less and were rude.We not only experienced rudeness in the lounge but also on the entire flight to and from Africa on top of this discrimination.  It was very clear that the employees are not fans of white people, doesn't matter where you are from.  Pressing the button on the flight for service went unanswered, yet they clearly saw the button as eye contact with the light by flight attendant was made (we have video of this).  We had to physically reach out of the aisle to ask for water from flight attendant.  Then it was given with an attitude, for disturbing them.  I wrote Kenya Air again of my negative experience and was given an apology and a credit voucher for a future flight.  I will never use this voucher as I never plan on flying them again.  I'm a world traveler and fly a ridiculous amount of miles.  This is hands down the worst airline and experience I have ever come across.

"I was super excited to travel to Zimbabwe and see Africa for the first time and got the perfect excuse when one of my closest friends from college planned her wedding in Harare. My outbound flight on American Airlines was cancelled due to weather, leading to me missing my connecting flight on Kenya Airways. While this was unpleasant, no one can control the weather, and AA helped re-book me on a later Kenya Airways flight into Harare, Zimbabwe, so I made it on time to the wedding.

After a few weeks of seeing Victoria Falls and making friends with lions, I got back to check into my flight back to the States with Kenya Airways. The attendant there helpfully let me know that I had been marked as a “no-show” on my outbound flight, and now my return ticket was cancelled as a result. After arguing that I clearly was re-booked on a later outbound flight, given my presence in Zimbabwe, and would very much like to return home, Kenya Airways told me I could get on the flight if I paid a “penalty” of $1200. As I had already paid for a round trip ticket, which typically include a flight home, I indignantly refused to pay for my flight a second time and wound up missing the morning flight. Two more flights back to the States came and went, and I missed all of those flights as Kenya Airways demanded ransom payments to let me out of the sweltering hot airport onto a plane. I racked up hours of international cell phone call payments with American Airlines customer service and my travel agent, who all let me know that Kenya Airways was not picking up the phone, and they were the only ones who could get me on one of their planes.

16 hours later, having missed every single flight that day, I finally gave in and paid the $1200 “penalty,” or really, the ransom payment, in addition to the $1600 round trip ticket I had already paid, and Kenya Airways let me on the flight back home. For the privilege of nearly doubling the cost of my plane ticket, I also had a 17 hour layover in Nairobi, after which Kenya Airways told me my flight to JFK was overbooked. At this point I had resigned myself to the fact I had probably died and was in some new circle of airline hell, but fortunately Kenya Airways did one thing right and found a seat for me onto the flight back to the States, which I had paid for twice. All in all, I wound up spending nearly four days total in airplanes and airports, racking up international phone charges, and nearly doubling the cost of my Kenya Airways ticket.

"Having heard mixed reviews about this airline, I decided to try it for myself before casting judgement. The entire online booking experience was promising and the ticket fares appeared to be competitive. I received numerous e-mails following the booking offering opportunities to upgrade to Business Class. Our routing was from Johannesburg to Nairobi on KQ763 (a short 4 hour flight on a Boeing 737-800) and then a short 90-minute layover at Jomo Kenyatta Airport before connecting to flight KQ886 which would take us to Bangkok. When checking in online the night before our flight, I experienced difficulty with the website which claimed that there was a ""system error"" making it impossible to complete the online check-in (even though I had completed all passport and other details for the two passengers travelling). I contacted the local office in Morningside, Sandton to be told that we could only check-in at OR Tambo Airport and should get there 3 hours before the flight. Later the same day, I received a SMS from the airline informing us of a 7,5 hour delay for flight KQ886 for ""technical/operational reasons"". On landing in Nairobi, I approached the airline desk to be told that we would be taken to a hotel close by and brought back in the morning to catch our flight to Bangkok. It was clear that there were many other passengers in the same situation as well as those who had missed connections due to late arrivals. After waiting for three hours in the airport we boarded a bus and drove for approximately 30 minutes to the hotel. They were not prepared for our arrival at all and chaos ensued. The meal that had been promised was not ready and it took another 45 minutes to get room access. It was 2:00am before we got to our room and we were told to be in the lobby at 4:00am for the return to the airport. At 4:00am there was no transport in sight. Fearful of missing our flight, we decided to hail an Uber taxi at 5:00am in order to get back to the airport. This fiasco led to us missing our domestic flight from Bangkok to Koh Samui, we missed one night of accommodation at our resort and also our pre-paid airport shuttles that were to take us to our destinations. This incompetence is such a pity considering that, once in the air, the flights are not bad at all. Service is friendly and efficient, the aircraft are clean and new (Boeing 787 Dreamliner is a great aeroplane) and the meals, whilst a bit small, are not bad at all.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f2/59/default-avatar-2020-24.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11Globetrotter11,11Globetrotter11 wrote a review Jan 2019,11Globetrotter11,"Johannesburg, South Africa",48 contributions,25 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Bangkok,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r644188559-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Such a wasted opportunity,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The point is that most of us fly economy and still pay a lot of money for these flights. Kenya Airways are not low-cost, and for regular working people, these flights are a substantial chunk of our savings. We work hard for this money and then spend it in good faith hoping that our hard work will be reciprocated with good service, newer airplanes, decent food, and on-time departures and arrivals. After all, we schedule vacations around what is possible with our jobs and kids’ school schedules. Kenya Airways who boast being “the Pride of Africa” are only missing the point. The point is this “good faith” must start at the top and trickle down. If there’s no real leadership at the top, the employees down the hierarchy will have no incentive, accountability, or feeling of ownership when it comes to providing a certain level of service. A smiling face of a CEO dressed in expensive clothes and watch is just missing the point. If you only cater to business/first travelers and forget about the majority economy travelers, you are missing the point. The feeling I got flying Kenya Airways for the first and last time is that it’s missing a certain culture which is so important for customer loyalty. The point is that if a plane is 15 years old and unpleasant, especially the toilets, but the service and timeliness of flights is on a high level, one does not notice the equipment. Our trip from Cape Town to Bangkok and back was the worst I’ve ever taken with any airline. Everything was matter of fact. Except for the last leg from Nairobi to Cape Town through Victoria Falls (which was still the wrong return flight and 24 hours too late) ALL flights were delayed between two and twelve hours. The on-board meals are half the size of comparable flights and mostly junk. Drinks cart selection looks like Aeroflot in the 80’s. Kenyans are warm and inviting. Is there a reason why that cannot be the same at Kenyatta airport? Is Kenya Airways not the major airline of that airport? When there’s no culture at the top, there’s no culture on the ground. Rude immigration officers and security personnel throwing bins at passengers. And everything done at snail pace, with total disregard and matter of fact. There are many wonderful and accommodating employees along the way, but that is not the point. We all tend to remember the negative and unpleasant, but the right kind of culture has no room for negative. Customers have choice, and if enough customers stop using Kenya Airways, will that make its point? ANY paying customer must not only receive the same high level of treatment the CEO would receive, even if our cutlery differs, but return home praising the little things. That IS the point.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/15/f9/8a/16/danielct1.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielCT1,Around the world Daniel wrote a review Jan 2019,Around the world Daniel,"New York City, New York",10 contributions,1 helpful vote,Bangkok - Cape Town Central,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r643724523-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Not The Pride of Africa,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Worst Flight of my life!

I flew Kenya airways from Johannesburg to Dar es Salaam via Nairobi on New years day, upon reaching the airport in Joburg I was unapologetically informed that the flight to Nairobi was delayed by two hours and as a result I would be missing my connection to Dar es Salaam. The next available flight was 6 hours later, I was irate and demanded that they at the least offer me access to their lounge in Nairobi where I could rest before my next flight. I left the counter after being promised that I would be taken care of in Nairobi and that I would receive my bags there, where I would then check them back in since I was worried they would be misplaced (not unheard of considering their reputation).

6 hours later I arrived at Nairobi airport shortly after 1am, navigated my way through airport security and immigration (East African Citizen so that wasnt much of a problem), only to find another surprise awaiting me, the Kenya airways desk was empty! security staff informed me that no one would be coming until after 4AM. Dejected, I sat at the empty airport for the next 3 hours until someone finally showed up. In the end all i got was a meal voucher for breakfast at a dirty, smelly, greasy spoon restaurant. The Kenya airways staff were rude and totally rejected my request for access to their lounge, citing that 6 hours is really not too much waiting time and I shouldnt expect anything from them. 6 hours of my time wasted due to their incompetence and they have the nerve to tell me that I should not expect anything from them?!

All in all, the worst experience ever! and ive flown Jetblue! Avoid this airline like the plague!

"This is my second trip with Kenya airlines. I'm so impressed with how this airline has made such an effort to deliver. We flew as a family of 8 from India, stopped over in Nairobi and had a connecting flight to Johannesburg. During the first flight, a young woman was sick and the crew asked for medical help. My fiance, who is a doctor volunteered. They then moved us( the 2 of us) to business class. The flight attendant Evelyn even took the recommendations about updating their first aid kit. She was such a pleasure. During that flight I left my travelling pillow on board. When we caught our next flight back to Johannesburg, one of the air hostesses handed me my pillow. I was so surprised. I have flown with Emirates and other such airlines. Kenya airlines really deserves a thumbs up for the effort that they are making in becoming Africa's best airline. I'm sure in the near future they will also upgrade the airport.

"Arrived at 8.30 am for 10.45 flight, airport board advising flight on time, at the check in we were told the flight was delayed until 13.05. We had a connecting flight from Nairobi to Entebbe so they changed our connection to 18.35.
They would not give a reason, several other passengers with connecting flights to South Africa, Zimbabwe, Johannesburg, and India were told they would have to miss their connection and fly the next day.....
After much complaining we were offered breakfast capped at 20,000Tzs, and told we would be able to use the Simba lounge in Nairobi.
10 am the boards were still reading flight on time.
Flight actually left Dar Es Salaam around 13.40, landing in Nairobi around 14.50, on arrival we found the 13.45 flight we should have been on originally had been delayed until 15.50, we were sent to the customer services desk where dozens of unhappy travellers were trying to sort out missed connections, some apparently having been trying for 3 days.....
We were told that we couldn't use the simba lounge, that the Kenya airways staff lied to us to pass on the problem. After several visits to the desk trying to sort something out we were told that the delayed 13.25 flight had left with ten empty seats. Our 1.5 hour connection was going to be almost four hours with no offer of refreshments or compensation.
Eventually persuading a me,her of staff that they were being unreasonable we were give lunch vouchers for a bottle of water and a plate of food.
The 18.35 flight was they delayed a further 30 minutes due to the late arrival of the incoming aircraft.
Kenya airways staff were unapologetic, unhelpful and lied to us.many passengers had their flights disrupted.
We learned that some passengers had checked in online, ( as we ourselves had tried), they had received an email about 11 pm the previous evening telling of the flight delay due to an aircraft problem in Nairobi.
How come they couldn't change the airport boards if they knew 11 hours before departure?
We have experienced Kenya airways double booking seats, delaying flights for logistical reasons claiming technical faults. Hopefully we will never have to fly with them again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnV336NA,JohnV336NA wrote a review Dec 2018,JohnV336NA,"Kalangala, Uganda",19 contributions,9 helpful votes,Dar es Salaam - Entebbe,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r641640159-Kenya_Airways-World.html,No customer care,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Just mindblown at this awful awful airline. I have to share my experience to warn other travellers to please beware and avoid!! We recently flew to Tanzania with them, via Kenya, Nairobi. Our plane from Douala so delayed (situation normal for any KA flights...every single flight is delayed..) we arrived in Nairobi so late, but would have managed to catch our connection to Tanzania by the skin of our teeth...however, the pilot of our connecting flight decided to leave early, LEAVE EARLY when he knew there were passengers connecting from another KA flight.....and guess what ?This was the last flight of the day!! So we had to over night in Kenya - in the airport - no bags, clean clothes etc etc ..and wait for the 9am flight the next morning. So we missed the first night in our luxury safari lodge. Next day flew to Tanzanian, oh the airplane staff decided the flight was too heavy , so took ours - and loads of other passengers - luggage off...we arrived in Tanzania with no luggage. Again, this is situation normal for this shambles of an airline... How can an airline sell you a ticket which includes luggage allowance - then decide they will just take it off, no warning, no asking would you mind, they just do it ?! So it was 48 hrs until we saw our bags again...!
Coming home from Tanzania...same old story...flight delayed 3 hours...got back into Doula, no luggage AGAIN...we were told, sorry they took luggage off the plane as it as so heavy...
4 days later, after numerous calls and emails, our luggage arrived at Douala, damaged, battered and broken. I was told I was lucky to get my luggage as its christmas time and the flights are full.
How the hell can you arrange to go on holiday with an airline that wont deliver your luggage for you to enjoy your holiday? The luggage allowance you have paid for with your ticket.
I warn you, book with them at your peril, but you will regret it !!! This is absolutely situation normal for them. Ive been travelling the world for 30 years, and never ever ever have I come across such a shambles of an airline. They call themselves the pride of africa....the JOKE of africa is more apt.

"Our luggage along with everyone else who connected to Nairobi from Kilimanjaro on 15/012/18, did not arrive at Heathrow leaving us without clothes etc for three days. Our bags were returned Tuesday evening, however, were in a completely unacceptable state (both wheels ripped off as well as the handle).

"In the last decade, we have always chosen Kenya airways to fly to Africa.
Pros-
1- It has a direct flight from Mumbai to Nairobi & then from Nairobi connecting flights to most of the other African countries.
2- Layover, if any at JKIA is easy & comfortable.
3- Lots of duty free shops at JKIA to do shopping & window shopping.
4- Availability of washrooms at JKIA in transit area.

Cons-
1- Earlier it used to take extra weight charges per kilogram & there was no restriction of carrying only 23 kgs per bag. We could carry even 28 kgs in a bag & had to pay extra weight for additional 5kgs only. But in our recent experience, everything had changed. Each bag should not be more than 23 kgs. Over & above 23kgs need a separate bag even if it is 4 kgs more. For this separate bag, Kenya airways charges were not per kgs but US $200 per bag irrespective of weight. So travellers are compelled to carry a separate bag & pay US $ 200 for it, whether it's 2kgs, 3kgs up to 23 kgs. It's a way of money making policy. Charge only for extra kilos of weight & not US $ 200 flat rate for any excess kilo of weight.

2- Food during flight- They have REDUCED the quantity of meals provided during flight.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NiRaj92,NiRaj92 wrote a review Dec 2018,NiRaj92,"Mumbai, India",879 contributions,14 helpful votes,Mumbai - Harare,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r640622997-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Changed policy for extra weight & food,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We came back from China with delay, but still we managed to present us in time at the boarding gate for our connecting flight. Having a valid boarding pass, the boarding staff said, we can't board, the flight would be full. Knowing that the next flight is the next day we insisted, but without help. The service desk, to which we were send, was catastrophically crowded and unorganised. Poor help or information was only provided after long insistence, hence our flight left without us.
We ended up, again only after persisting insistence, being send to our destination via three East Africa airports to reach 10 hours later than we would have, if they would have let us board.
Our suitcases were delivered 4 days later.
Despite the immense frustration standing in front of your plane and being not allowed to board, I further feel ignored, as I haven't received the passengers denied boarding policy, stated in the terms and conditions. So, till today, after many insistence, I am not aware about my rights.
This was for us, as platinum frequent travellers the worst ever experience.
Further to that, even service and food on board have gone down, we were not happy being served poor food sealed in plastic bags with plastic forks and knifes.

I would say travelling with Kenya airways is probably the best flight to go to Kenya. The service is really good and the crew members are friendly and helpful. The planes to Kenya are very new - the Boeing 787 planes. The economy class is quite spacious compared to the British airways planes where the planes are old and the facilities are old too. The service on Kenya airways is better than British airways. I have travelled with both airlines to Kenya many times and I would choose Kenya airways over British airways when flying to Nairobi! I have also flown with business class with Kenya airways.. the service is very very good.. the seats turn into flat beds with a remote control and crew members make you feel very comfortable and welcome!,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aakash304,aakash304 wrote a review Dec 2018,aakash304,"Nairobi, Kenya",5 contributions,8 helpful votes,London - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r640198586-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Great airline,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This is a long flight but a whole lot better than connecting through Europe or the Persian Gulf. If a flight is just going from point to point this is a fabulous flight. If a flight is an opportunity for an experience of any nature then there's not much about this flight that stands out. I should point out that the flight from Nairobi to New York, as the New York to Nairobi flight, was just about half or less than half empty. I had 3 seats to myself both ways so for me those flights were very comfortable but you can't depend on that. Shortly after takeoff from Nairobi we got a very meager dinner, arguably the least impressive of all the dinners I've ever had on comparable flights in economy. No one expects great wine in economy but the red wine I had on this flight was at the low end of that already low range. On the outbound flight I had a couple of packages of macadamia nuts, a VERY impressive and delicious improvement over the tiny bags of peanuts you get on a Delta flight. But on the return flight there were no nuts at all (I was looking forward to them). The movie/TV selection was good enough but not exceptional. The breakfast was  better than the dinner the night before so that slightly redeemed the meal aspect of the flight. The flight crew was very friendly and accommodating but how much can they do for you in economy? It was really a great flight, but only because I had 3 seats to be able to lie down and sleep comfortably. I would still opt again for this flight just because it's so much more convenient than connecting through any other airport.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/b9/ef/f7/nigerdave.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nigerdave,Nigerdave wrote a review Dec 2018,Nigerdave,"Cazenovia, New York",240 contributions,78 helpful votes,Nairobi - New York City,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r639610294-Kenya_Airways-World.html,The newly inaugurated KQ flight from New York to Nairobi is a great convenience,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"In a simple slip-of-mind, the leader of my group advised me that my departure date was incorrect by one day. This error was realized 3 months before the flight. There was a comparable flight on the same airline that was available one day earlier for the same price that I paid. The service agent insisted on a $300 fee and refused to allow me to speak with a supervisor. Filing a complaint with the corporate office yielded an equally unhelpful response. The change would have incurred no inconvenience or loss of revenue to the airline, but their insistence on enforcing this absurd change fee reflects the fact that they are a mercenary airline, whose only interest is squeezing the customer for their money.

"My husband and I had the most terrible trip with Kenya Airways today. We were supposed to have a 1-hour stop-over on our way to a much anticipated and relaxing holiday at Zanzibar. But then this happened...

We got onto our connecting flight on time. After driving to the point where we should’ve taken off, the pilot announced that there were some technical difficulties that should be checked. So we drove back to the ‘parking spot’. And there we sat. In a closed airplane. For at least an hour.

I should also probably say that this was an early morning flight, so we would’ve gotten breakfast. But alas, no.

After an hour in the plane we were asked to get off as it was not safe to fly.

Then we followed a guy to the domestic flights desk and there we were for another 2 hours (without any food in the vacinity) just trying to get a new flight ASAP. It took exactly 1,5hours for the manager to show up, and after a lot of fighting we heard that we could get a flight later that evening.

So, we got a flight - yeah! On the same day that we paid for - yeah! And we got 4 hours in a hotel to freshen up plus lunch - yeah!

However, I’m still quite angry. I missed my first day of my 7 days in Zanzibar (I know I sound so spoiled). But, hey, they say time is money. And this time was not worth the money.

Think twice before you choose Kenya Airways as a stop-over on your way to a nice idyllic holiday. It might just make you more stressed out than you were before.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/b2/d3/86/marike-s.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarikeSpang,MarikeSpang wrote a review Dec 2018,MarikeSpang,,2 contributions,1 helpful vote,Cape Town Central - Zanzibar Island,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r639087882-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Kenya Airways ruined the beginning of a much needed holiday in Zanzibar!,Date of travel: December 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I was travelling with my daughter who needed special assistance so double checked this at every stage. At check in i asked if a wheelchair had been arranged at Nairobi and for our connecting flight to Mombasa as was told yes, not so in reality. Had pre booked a right aisle seat to allow my daughter to stretch her right leg out but when on the plane found they had given us a middle and left aisle seat so ended up asking to swap seats with another traveller.

Was told by check in that our luggage would go straight to Mombasa so no need to collect it at Nairobi. Incorrect information and it was only due to the fact that the person who was pushing the wheelchair (when they eventually got us one) saying we needed to collect it we would have left it at Nairobi airport. That would have meant we'd have been without our luggage for the first couple of days of our holiday.

That said it was reasonably priced and got us to our destination. The cabin staff were good it was the check in staff that let them down. When checking in at Mombasa for our return flight the check in lady was extremely rude and wanted to know why my daughter was in the wheelchair. Considering she was in a full leg brace I'd have said it was obviously needed. They need to have a little more consideration for disabled travellers and just because my daughter is young does not mean she doesn't require assistance.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/483mandyr,mandy r wrote a review Dec 2018,mandy r,"Gloucester, United Kingdom",39 contributions,25 helpful votes,London - Mombasa,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r638669740-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Special Assistance was erratic,Date of travel: November 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Every time when you need to fly to East Africa there is no direct flight option other than Kenya Airways. Every time I ask myself why I fly with this Airline why not SAA via J'burg. Time is the answer but its just fooling myself because with Kenya Airways you either lose time or your luggage or your connection or all the above. When this happens and you try to contact customer services they just hang up the phone and leave you stranded wherever you are at the moment even in their home base Nairobi. It is appalling. Rather do Ethiopian via Addis at least that is a safe and reliable route.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ets10,Ets10 wrote a review Dec 2018,Ets10,"Johannesburg, South Africa",88 contributions,45 helpful votes,Luanda - Nairobi,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r638596038-Kenya_Airways-World.html,delayed airline with bad services,Date of travel: June 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Kenyan airways is a very solid airlines and their planes for long haul are excellent. Leg room is good and the air hostesses cater to your needs. They do attend to requests like blankets and juice or water even after serving meals.

The in-flight entertainment is shady at best. The movie choice is limited. Not great selection of music. The series are limited in number.

The aeroplanes are magnificent and this was an Airbus A350 which had plenty of room to stretch my legs.

"Missed connections both out and inbound due to delays caused by KQ. Had to spend a night in Kenya instead of beautiful Mauritius, where I was supposed to have 2 nights. Took more than four hours to sort out hotels, transfers and to retrieve luggage. Airline was u able to retrieve my bag after for house.  I bought some toiletries etc for the night totaling about $10 and they refused to reimburse me the cost. On return again missed connection. Due to delay leaving Mauritius. Instead of booking me on next flight to my destination which was with a partner, they booked another KQ fight, which also ended up being delayed so more hours seating at the airport in Kenya.  For breakfast we were give a voucher which only provided teas toast and eggs. I don’t eat eggs do too bad. A full breakfast at the cheap restaurant they use is $10, but apparently that is too much for KQ to spen on customers they inconvenienced, who paid close to $1000 for their tickets.

Had no problems flight or seatwise and would use again.

The choice of in flight entertainment however, was poor. They showed films from years before, and there were no new releases at all being shown. It was the same for music too.

"There is a reason some airlines consistently get bad reviews - they are BAD!
I travel a lot and Kenya Airways without doubt gets the prize for worst airline this year.

I was flying Kilimanjaro to Seychelles, changing planes at Nairobi. Kenya airways cancelled the first flight, didn't tell me & rebooked me on a later plane - which arrived at Nairobi 3 hours after the onward flight had already left there! How stupid was that?!

Buy merest chance I discovered this mistake a week before the journey, and managed to change the first flight to an early one which meant leaving the hotel at 3 a.m.
Meaning this simple journey would now take about 16 hours of travelling including a massive stopover in Nairobi. NOT great for 65yr olds.

Had I not discovered the cancellation in time, we would not have reached Seychelles that day. We could not have stopped overnight in Nairobi as we had no multi-entry visa.
We would have lost hundreds in hotels and booked onwards arrangements.
It turns out that first flight is cancelled regularly - typically 1 day each week.

Did Kenya Airways care or try to do anything for us? Not a thing.
I asked Kenya airways if, given it was their mistake, we could have access to rest in the Nairobi business Lounge or even get an upgrade to business (only 4 seats in business had been sold on that flight so lots and lots of room)

No, nothing said the agent.
Fill in our customer form said Facebook.
Zero response from customer services, then or since
Utter waste of time.

In the event we paid to upgrade to business. What a waste of money! The Business Lounge was tiny and poor. Meals in business class were worse than in most Airlines economy. Oh and the plane from Nairobi took off and arrived late (for no good reason) making the day even longer.

And guess what: I got an email inviting me to check in for the flight - that had been cancelled.

Kenya Airways are lucky they have a captive market of Kenyans, because I can't see any European ever flying with them more than once!

"Our group did a round trip from New York (JFK) to Kilimanjaro (JRO) with a stop in Nairobi (NBO). The NBO <-> JRO leg was operated by Precision Air.

The flights were booked about 3 months in advance, yet the airlines kept changing the flight numbers & times of our last leg (NBO to JRO & JRO to NBO). Some of these changes would have made it very difficult for us to catch our connecting flights. We had to be in constant communication with the Kenya Airways customer service to get confirmation. Even after the changes, I was still getting e-mails with the old flight information.

At JFK, the check-in representative could only tag our luggage to NBO, & said they would need to be retagged for JRO at NBO. As soons as we landed in NBO, we went to the Kenya Airways desk to check into our next flight & get our luggage retagged. We provided our our baggage ticket stub, & they gave us our boarding ticket & assured us that our luggage will be retagged. We did not see them physically retag our checked-in luggage. Our wait in NBO until our flight to JRO was around 7 hours as planned. For 7 hours, they had time to retag our checked-in luggage. An hour before boarding, we returned to the desk to confirm that our bags were retagged & being loaded onto the flight. They promised us again that that was true. When we landed in JRO, our luggage was missing.

We were without our luggage for 3 nights out of our 7 night stay in Tanzania.

"Where to begin? There is no option for economy comfort (the plane was a 3-3-3 configuration) so this long haul flight is either economy or business. We had preselected our seats when we purchased our tickets but had been reseated apart from each other when we checked in (no reason given). The plane was HOT and crowded and the seats cramped and uncomfortable which made the possibility of sleep almost nil (departed at 20:50). After the meal service, the lights were dimmed. Due to the policy of free unlimited alcohol, however, this did not mean that people were quiet. There were a few loud drunks on board who had delightfully chosen not to sit next to each other and were shouting across rows. The cabin crew, perhaps understandably, did nothing to quiet these people, but did bring them more alcohol any time they requested it. I was not seated next to them, but was still kept awake by their endless ranting. Arriving in Nairobi I felt rattled, groggy, and, frankly gross, because the temperature had been uncomfortably high (felt like at least 25C). This was a leisure trip and definitely started my holiday off in a negative mood.
After talking with other people, it appears that drunken disorderly passengers are not uncommon on Kenya Airways and they would be my last choice if other options are available.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ed/ce/default-avatar-2020-7.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yogarobin,yogarobin wrote a review Nov 2018,yogarobin,"Delft, The Netherlands",159 contributions,97 helpful votes,Amsterdam - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r635241213-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Uncomfortable and loud,Date of travel: October 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I traveled with my wife from Mumbai to Nairobi on Kenya Airways in November 2018 and getting on the flight and the flight attendants were good and friendly. When they came to serve refreshments which i was looking forward to. They served a cheap vodka which tasted awful had no Gin and the selection of alcohol was very little to say the least. You either had Vodka, Whisky or Rum that was it. All of them weren't premium brands and to be honest i never heard of the brand they were serving. I had one drink my wife had no choice but to drink a juice and she does not drink the options offered. On a 6 hour flight they only came round once and to be honest the taste was so awful that I don't think anyone would have had a second drink.

Totally loved  the flight to Nairobi - the flight was smooth - the jet excellent - staff were on point .  The flight back not so much - flight was cancelled - staff didn’t know how to handle it well - only very minimal assistance given - no one knew what to do at immigration and Kenya airlines staff were nowhere to be seen - hotels were over booked and vans back to the airport were late leading to an awkward rush through immigration to the plane. On the flight back the hostess seemed like we were an inconvenience to her .

"As a specialist tour operator, several times a year I fly back and forth to Kenya, and usually have up to 100 or more guests flying into the country over a season.

In August/September this year I decided to give Kenya Airways a try as they had added new Dreamliner aircraft to their fleet. My flight up to Nairobi which I upgraded for my wife & me to Business Class was very good.

However when it came to the time to return I once again checked online, saw the scheduled aircraft was the Dreamliner, and once again upgraded three seats, mine, my wife’s and my nephew’s, who’d worked the Mara season with us and I thought I’d give him a little reward.

However on arrival at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport the morning of our flight, September 29, there was great confusion and consternation until they admitted we’d been downgraded back to Economy...despite the fact I could show proof that my upgrades had been approved and my Visa card debited.

The airline ground crew were very apologetic and it appeared that there may have been some important politicians wanting to fly that morning, as well as the fact that the aircraft was downscaled to an old 737.

Fortunately we did manage to get our check in luggage accepted at the Business Class allowance (Note: Kenya Airways allows Economy passengers only half the allowance that SAA allows. This is an important consideration when going on a long safari. Kenya Airways gives you 1x23kg, SAA 2x23).

Later, once already seated on board, the aircraft cabin staff approached my wife and me and offered us seats (not together) up front in Business Class but left our nephew in Economy. So much for the kid’s big treat.

We were told by the cabin attendant to apply for a refund once we got back to South Africa, though they did not have the forms they should have given us for this application.

Hahahaha!

KenyaAirways have given me the total runaround over this ever since. I have sent them copies of tickets, boarding passes, the letter of approval for the upgrade saying my Visa card would be debited and still I wait.

Every time I contact them I get redirected to a website to fill in and supply the exact same details all over again.

Now seven weeks later I think I have to give up...and I will certainly NOT use Kenya Airways again. I will also warn my guests against this airline as customer service and satisfaction seems to be very low on their agenda. You have been warned!

"We had booked our flights 11 months before the trip, pretty much as soon as they became available. Initially we had direct flights from Entebbe to Abu Dhabi through Etihad, however I think due to it being down season, they changed the leg to include Kenya Airways flight from Entebbe to Nairobi.

That morning before we left for the airport we had no emails to suggest any flight changes. It was only when we got to the airport did we find out, the flight had been cancelled. No explanation was given and the ground staff appeared to also be in the dark with what had happened. We got to the airport early, and service tried to get us on the earlier flight, however we were not able to get on, as only 1 of us could get a ticket before the ticketing system crashed. They managed to get us on the subsidiary budget airline Jambojet. It was 30 minutes late, meaning we had less than 40 minutes to connect onto our next flight. This required us to run flat out to the boarding gate in Nairobi. Fortunately we got there and Etihad's staff were able to sort us onto the next two flights and even take opportunities to make our next two flights more pleasant.

Our experience has made us unlikely to even flight Kenya Airways. Whilst it is appreciated the Entebbe staff were able to get us one another flight, had we been on time for our flight, rather then quite early, there is no way we would have been assisted in time to have made the Jambojet flight, as there were at least 100 people displaced due to the flight cancellation and we wouldn't have gotten home for at least another day.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/5a/default-avatar-2020-36.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Courtz47,Courtz47 wrote a review Nov 2018,Courtz47,"Brisbane, Australia",2 contributions,,Entebbe - Nairobi,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r631806452-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Cancelled Kenya Airways Flight,Date of travel: November 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"On 07 Sept, 2018 my wife and I were travelling business class by a Kenya Airways flight from Mumbai to Kilimanjaro. Two pieces of baggage were through-checked-in from Bangalore(our origin by Jet Airways) to Mumbai to Nairobi to Kilimanjaro. One of the two pieces arrived in Kilimanjaro while the other got left behind in Nairobi (night of Sept 07/08).

The loss of one piece of baggage was recorded by Swissport, the baggage handling agent in Kilimanjaro, with a promise that it will arrive in a later flight from Nairobi and be delivered at our hotel in Arusha (Mount Meru Hotel)

After several phone calls to Kenya Airways Central Contact Centre and constant follow-up throughout the day with the Swissport agent in Kilimanjaro, we were told at 7 pm on 08 Sept 2018 that the baggage has arrived but we have to go over to Kilimanjaro Airport to collect it, The airport is about 50 Kms away and we were to leave by a very early flight the next morning (09 Sept 2018) from a small airport in Arusha to a safari camp in the interior of Tanzania. It was going to be very inconvenient and taxing at that time of the night to travel a total of 100 kms to get back our baggage.

In the first place, the airlines goofed up by delivering only one piece of baggage and leaving the other midway, which is a great inconvenience as all my clothes were in the lost piece. Secondly, asking us to go over 50 Kms to collect the retrieved baggage was cruel (Kenya Airways should take this up with their agent, Swissport). It was extremely annoying to handle the guy on duty at Swissport on the night of 08 Sept 2018. So, we requested the Duty Manager at Hotel Mount Meru, Arusha to help us, which he willingly did. He took it upon himself, though it was not in his line of duty. He went out of his way to uphold the pride of Tanzania as a tourist destination. He was very clear in his mind that the guy at Swissport, Kilimanjaro Airport, was duty-bound to deliver lost baggage to our hotel and eventually ensured that it was done. I have written about this not-so-common show of initiative by a Duty Manager at a hotel in my review of our stay in Hotel Mount Meru, Arusha on 08/09 Sept 2018.

Kenya Airways would have to (1) take it up strongly with Swissport to ensure that its employees adhere to contract terms (that would have been entered into between themselves) and (2) put in place fail-safe practices at Nairobi airport, to ensure that piece-meal loading is avoided (either both pieces of baggage arrive or both pieces are lost, you can't have a little bit of each, that too at a major hub, Nairobi, the headquarters of Kenya Airways). It has been my habit to always check with the airline's agent at a transit point (when boarding) whether the baggage has been transferred. To my utter disappointment, the agent at Nairobi looked into the computer and confirmed to me that the two pieces were indeed loaded. This was obviously a big bluff.

The intention of this feedback is to ensure that Kenya Airways takes note of these lapses and provides better service in future.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/5b/default-avatar-2020-61.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BussaBangalore_India,BussaBangalore_India wrote a review Nov 2018,BussaBangalore_India,"Bangalore,India",6 contributions,2 helpful votes,Mumbai - Kilimanjaro National Park,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r631522917-Kenya_Airways-World.html,"Kenya Airways' Agent,Swissport reluctant to deliver Lost Baggage at our Hotel in Aursha (50 Kms from Kilimajaro Airport)",Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Return flights from London to Kenya, and about all that the airline has to commend it are that it got us there in one piece and didn't cost very much.

Check in was confusing in London - you can check in on line but you can't actually check in on line. TIA.

Seats were rather squished, especially when the person in front of you leans their seat back.

In flight entertainment is limited to 100 movies across all languages.

In flight meal service was extremely slow, leaving you sitting with your finished meal tray long after you have eaten it. And there is not much on the meal tray. After the meal service, you won't see or here from the cabin crew except for when they are doing the duty free service. If you want some water, you'll have to go to the back of the plane for it yourself.

Toilets were not kept stocked with supplies throughout the flight, and I had to repeatedly put the toilet roll back on the holder.

On the way to Kenya we had a connecting flight at Nairobi for Mombasa an hour and a half later. Our luggage being clearly marked ""short transfer"" must be to indicate to the baggage handlers to leave this luggage until last, as everyone with a short transfer to Mombasa ended up waiting the best part of an hour in Nairobi to collect their baggage. After collecting it, we then had to rush to take it to be screened in Terminal 1A and across the airport courtyard (across unlevel surfaces with no straight route between the terminals) to be screened again at Terminal 1D. TIA.

Apart from the luggage and transfer experience, passable overall by my standards. Would put up with it again if going back to Kenya given the only other option for direct flights is BA.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zoodle,Zoodle wrote a review Nov 2018,Zoodle,London,50 contributions,75 helpful votes,London - Mombasa,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r631294828-Kenya_Airways-World.html,"Passable, but TIA",Date of travel: October 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The only negatives about Kenya Airways are not due to them: the check-in area in Tambo airport in Terminal A is dim and crowded and the Nairobi airport is really lacking in all kinds of modern conveniences.

"Just arrived in NYC after flying Kenya Airlines newly opened route from Nairobi to JFK!!

I started my journey in Johannesburg. Check in was smooth. Although they couldn’t give me my boarding pass for the second leg of my journey!

Kenya Airlines utilize the Bidvest Premier Lounge at O.R Tambo. Which is decent. Quite busy. But not chic. The newer SLOW lounge shared by the other SkyTeam airlines is way cooler and has a much better selection of drinks and food.

The flight to Nairobi was delayed by an hour (but we made up the time en route) with an on time landing!

Boarding was a little chaotic. Better signage would help.

On board the hard product is great! The Dreamliner has a 2-2-2 configuration. And has three rows in one cabin, separated by the boarding doors and galley and then two rows in a second, directly in front of economy.

I was fortunate to be in 2D. Middle row in the front cabin for both legs of the journey! I need to point out that there are no overhead bins available for rows 1 and 2 center seats. But saying that there was plenty of available space on both flights.

This seat is one of my favorites, plenty of space. It’s a lay flat. And is super comfy and wide. I would take this seat, with the risk of people sitting next to me or climbing over me. Over some of the smaller, cramped all aisle access seats that are out there. (Think Delta One 767!)

I slept a solid 8 hours on my second flight!! And close to two hours on my first!

The service on board was actually quite good. The FA team take huge pride in what they do and they are genuinely honored to do the work they do. Personal standards are on point. Think Emirates!!

The food was actually really great! On my first flight I had the beef Babotie - which was AWESOME. (The food on both flights was really good!)

On my second flight I had the vegetarian option - the giant gnocchi, which was nice. For the mid-flight snack I had the pizza slice. (Although I think the burger may have been a better choice). And for the huge breakfast I had the fluffy omelet with chicken sausage. Included in breakfast is a fruit selection, yogurt, cereal and muffin. One of the biggest breakfasts I’ve ever had on a plane and only beaten by Emirates 1st Class.

A decent selection of beverages is offered as well. The only downside is there is quite a delay before being served the first beverage after take off!

They don’t use duvets on board, and have opted for blankets instead. At first I was not a fan. But actually these are quite nice. The pillows, however, are quite flat. I snagged a second one on my first flight which made a big difference! Not so lucky on the second flight as Business was 100% full!

The IFE system is great and has a decent selection of movies, TV and Audio options (including audio books).

Deplaning in Nairobi was seemless. Security was pretty smooth as well. The only drag is that I was not able to get my boarding pass until much later. After being directed to the transit desk.

I knew I was going to be in Nairobi for a long layover and checked into the brand new Four Point Sheraton - which is fabulous. Going though passport control can be quite a process. And took longer than anticipated.

Hint - the taxis are quite a scene and the drivers are super aggressive. Even this 6’2 hardened New Yorker felt a little apprehensive. If you’re staying at any of the airport hotels. Email in advance and have their courtesy car pick you up. Learn from my mistake!

Check in, passport control and security at Niarobi was once again smooth. The lounge is small and despite being new looks quite shabby. But then again, some of the travelers using it have little respect for it either. Which is quite sad.

Be prepared for a quite intense second security screening before boarding flights for the USA!

And the boarding process was a bit of a mess with almost everyone rushing to board at the same time. Kenya Airways will have to address this! I had maneuvered myself near the front, so was one of the first to board!

Overall - Kenya Airways offers a really good hard product, great service and food and beverage choices. They will need to address the boarding process and a look at how they manage the lounge in Nairobi. I paid a little over $2000 for a round trip Business Class ticket from JHB to JFK. (I think as part of their inaugural promotions) Which is a really great bargain. Saying that. If the price gets closer to the completion. I may select to stick with KLM or Virgin Atlantic.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/e6/default-avatar-2020-45.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KesterCB,KesterCB wrote a review Nov 2018,KesterCB,,279 contributions,43 helpful votes,Johannesburg - New York City,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r630835954-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Kenya Airlines - solid business class at great value!,Date of travel: November 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Best service of an African carrier that is all the way leading on the continent. Kenya Airways gives you the warmth feel of Kenya once you step on board. The service is always great and the crew are so friendly. Flying the dreamliner makes it more comfortable and am always the first to book Kenya Airways to fly when visiting Kenya. Their own Terminal in Nairobi makes transfers and getting around so easy.

"Do not fly!!! This is, hands down, the worst airline experience I’ve ever had, and I’ve traveled quite a bit. My husband and I are on our honeymoon and flew Kenya Airways from Zambia to Nairobi and then Nairobi to the Seychelles. The airline kept sending us emails to upgrade to business, so we thought it would be fine and upgraded. From the moment we attempted to check in in Lusaka, this was an issue. The counter claimed we owed money, even though we showed them the email confirmation and bank payment. They left our bags unattended and made us go through security again, took our passports, and seemed like they were just trying to make us pay a second time for our tickets. They couldn’t figure it out after 2 hours and we almost missed our flight before they put us on the plane and agreed to have us “sort it out” for our next flight. We tried to resolve the issue when we landed in Nairobi and were directed to ticketing when they couldn’t solve it, again. Ticketing said everything was fine and to arrive at 9:10am the next day (it was nearly midnight at this point) for our 11:10am flight. In the morning, the counter had the same issue, not seeing our upgraded reservation. They finally figured it out and handed us tickets departing two hours later. When we asked when the flight had changed and why we hadn’t been informed, they shrugged. We were exhausted from travel and needed the extra sleep, but there was zero communication about the departure time change- funny, because all we’d gotten leading up to the flight was offers to upgrade. When we went to customer service, they were rude, incompetent, and actively unhelpful. They suggested we enjoy the lounge. We asked repeatedly to refund the upgrade and why we hadn’t been informed of the delay (they claimed the flight time had changed weeks ago!), and they literally laughed. It’s a dysfunctional, corrupt airline, and it should be put out of businesses. No one should ever fly this.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2a/fd/95/avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R5653NSsarahm,Sarah T wrote a review Nov 2018,Sarah T,"Los Angeles, California",4 contributions,2 helpful votes,Nairobi - Victoria,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r630407143-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Mrs.,Date of travel: November 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Having flown with Kenya Airways many times we were pleased to see that their standards have not dropped. In fact, the flight out from Heathrow to Nairobi (Economy Class) was very good. The Stewards are always very attentive and nothing is too much trouble for them even though they are rushed off their feet at times. The list of films to watch was also impressive with many new titles - it does help to pass the time on Long Haul! The meals were also fine and of course served with free drinks.

"This is the WORST company ever. To make it short I had a flight from Brazzaville to Paris sunday the 26th of august and there was two stops, one at Pointe Noire and the other at Nairobi. We were supposed to arrived monday the 27th at night time. But the company put all the passengers from Brazzaville and Pointe Noire on the same plane so it was overbooked... Not a single person from Brazzaville took the flight. We had to wait more than 36 hours before getting a new flight. This time it was Brazzaville-Nairobi-Dubaï-Paris... Everyone was annoyed but this is the best we could get with this INCOMPETENT company. During the stops we had no idea in which hotel we were supposed to sleep. They simply told us we would get one. We had to look alone through the WHOLE aiports ourselves, get a Visa in Nairobi because the hotel was outside of the aiport. We weren't even warned, fortunetly it was free because it was just a night. In Dubaï we slept in the hotel of the airport but it was so huge it also was really sporty to find it. There were children with us, parents with BARELY any food, diapers etc... left and they didn't care. Then we arrived in Paris but it wasn't the final destination for my family. My brother needed to go to Brussels, and the rest of us to Nantes. They PROMISED us they would pay the trains in Brazzaville. In Nairobi they said what happened to us was a RECCURENT PROBLEM, and we would get NO REFUND. We paid our trains alone, we spent 300e (341$) in total. Another passenger was going Canada, he paid 1000e (1139$)... In Paris we had to sleep in the AIRPORT, they didn't care because we were at our final destination.

"There are currently three flights per day between NBO and JNB.  Some flights are the Boeing 787 - which is an interesting experience - and others are the Boeing 737.  Business class in the 737 is much different from the 787.  Kenya is expanding, and will soon start its daily service NBO-JFK; and offering that new route has shaken up its schedule all over Africa.  Traveling within Africa is very often scheduled at inconvenient times; that, in my view, is an opportunity for an African airline if it would wish to make the investment.  For this flight - the 737 business class had plenty of leg room and the service was attentive.  The food in business was the same as in economy, except it was on a china plate.  Many of the North American, European and African airlines could learn from the service provided by their Asian competitors.

"My sister and I arrived at the airport for our Kenya Airways flight to Nairobi with connection to Dar Es Salaam on 8/8/18. We were supposed to be picked up from the airport in Dar Es Salaam by our tour guides and taken straight on a 3 day safari. We booked and paid for our flights with Kenya Airways 2 months ago believing Kenya Airways to be a reliable airline. When we arrived 2 hours prior to our flight to check in, we were told that the flight was full. Despite the fact that we had arrived within the requested time to check in and had paid 2 months prior to the flight, we were kicked off the flight. There were multiple other passengers that also were not able to check in because of too many ticket sales - 1 of them had been able to buy a ticket that same morning online despite there obviously not being any left! We purchased our tickets 2 months ago - how were there still tickets on sale the same morning and yet we, who purchased our tickets 2 whole months ago were kicked off the flight?! This is unacceptable!! Another had arrived 2 1/2 hour prior to departure and had still been kicked off. He had also purchased his tickets much later than we had!
We were out in a hotel for the night with boarding passes printed for the next flight in 24 hours but also with the promise by Kenya Airways staff that early the next day they would try to find an alternative flight to get us to Dar Es Salaam earlier. We were already going to miss our airport pickup, who was taking us straight onto a 3 day safari for which I had already paid $300 US for. We were interrupted during breakfast to rush back to the airport. The staff told us we had been booked onto an Ethiopian airways flight through Addis Ababa but they did not have flight details to supply us with. They cancelled our tickets for the Kenya Airways flight that night. After a long wait in line, the check-in staff found only 1 ticket, rather than 2. They couldn’t tell us arrival time in Dar Es Salaam but checked in our bags and a long time later gave us boarding passes. On checking them, we discovered our route would now include a 26-hour stopover in Addis. Not only were we leaving a day later than our initial flight, but we would be now be arriving 48 hours later - a whole 24 hours later than if we had gone with the later Kenya Airways flight. On showing the staff at Kenya airways what they had swapped us over to, they then told us the Kenya airways flight that night was already full and we couldn't fly. Seriously, this was ridiculous. We were made to go back to the hotel and brought back to the airport that evening without any communication as to whether we would even be flying.
There was no offer of any compensation for the mess made by Kenya Airways - no upgrade, not even an airport lounge, no offer of a partial refund, not even an apology, even after I filed a customer complaint via their website. Instead they just say they pride themselves on customer service over and over again. We had a completely wasted day with massive amounts of stuffing around by Kenya Airways. None of it was due to anything that we did wrong. ALL of it was because Kenya airways overbooks their flights to make extra money.

"I checked in early 21:30 for a 00:55 departure. Kenya Airways ""shrink wrapped"" all checked in luggage for this flight. Note that once airside JNB OR Tambo Airport starts to shut down so there were limited places to eat or get a drink and most of the duty free shops had closed.

The flight wasn't full but there was an hour delay to departure due to a technical problem which needed to be fixed before passengers could board.

The flight wasn't full so I had 3 seats to myslef and could lie down to get some sleep for the 4 hour night flight.

A hot snack was served shortly after take off. Kenya Airways should provide a more substantial meal for thsi service as there isn't much available in the airport and many passengers are changing plances in Nairobi.

The in flight entertainment system worked well but I had already seen most of what I wanted to see. Due to thunder storms en route there was some turbulence and we had to keep seat belts fastened.

Another small hot snack was served prior to arrival in Nairobi at 06:00. Kenya Airways could do better with the quality of the catering for this flight. Many passengers were joing connceting flights and would not have time to get food in Nairobi.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/21/07/f2/discofins.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/discofins,discofins wrote a review Oct 2018,discofins,,23 contributions,1 helpful vote,Johannesburg - Nairobi,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r627335286-Kenya_Airways-World.html,KQ 765 JNB to NBO,Date of travel: October 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I was continuing my overnight journey from London to Cape Town after changing planes in Nairobi. My luggage was checked-in through from London.

Nairobi was hot and humid and there was air conditioning in the airport. There was a long queue to get through security and it was very busy at 05:00.

We boarded the Embraer aircraft after a bus tranfser from the airport. The flight was full. I had my pre-booked window seat as requested.

Great view of Mount Kilimanjaro very shortly after take off from the left had side of the aircraft.

The cold refresher towels were a nice touch after the tropical humidity of the airport building.

Hot brekfast was served about 45 mins into the flight. It was tasty enough but very little. Cabin crew were friendly but could have been more generous with the juices and water as many of us had transferred from other flights and were thirsty.

The stopover in Livingstone was uneventful. KA was the only only aircraft on the apron. Passengers continuing to Cape Town could not disembark the aircraft and some passengers had to change seats for the second leg of the journey.

The in flight entertainmet system did work but I had already exhausted what I wanted to see on the overnight flight from London to Nairobi.

Shortly after take off from Livingstone we were served with a bar service and lunch - which was very welcome. Luch was tasty. The red wine was particularly good.

The conncetion to Cape Town was only 2:45 and we expericnced some turbulence for the final hour of the flight, so had to keep seat belts fastened.

My luggage arrived safely in Cape Town.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/21/07/f2/discofins.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/discofins,discofins wrote a review Oct 2018,discofins,,23 contributions,1 helpful vote,Nairobi - Cape Town Central,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r627331097-Kenya_Airways-World.html,KQ 782 Nairobi to Cape Town via Livingstone,Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Check in was uneventful and only a small queue of about 5 persons 3 hours before departure. The flight boarded on time but there was a 40 minute delay after boarding to fix a technical problem. The airline changed my pre-booked seat from a window to a mid isle which was particularly unpleasant as I was sat next to a 3 year old who could not sit still. I couln't get much sleep. The flight was full.

The entertainment system worked fine but I was dissapointed that there was no classical music selection to listen to as it helps me sleep.

Dinner and drinks were served late into the overnight flight - more than 2 hours after take off. The drinks service was very slow to follow the meal so many passengers stared eating without something to drink. The lamb curry was tasty enough for an ecomomy class meal.

Light cold breakfast was served around 04:00 for a 05:00 arrival in Nairobi.

Kenya Airways want ot market Nairobi as a HUB destination with onward conncetions accross Africa - they will need to learn from other HUB airlines such as Emirates and Quatar that food quality and service are important to distinguish them from their competition.

It was good enough for the price but AF, Lufthansa, Emirates and Quatar also provide a very competitive service.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/21/07/f2/discofins.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/discofins,discofins wrote a review Oct 2018,discofins,,23 contributions,1 helpful vote,London - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r627326589-Kenya_Airways-World.html,KQ 101,Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"One of the best flights I've been on. It was a new plane with the new entertainment system, spacious seats and stellar service. Sadly the older planes seem to have problems and are no way near as comfortable.

"On July 2, my wife and I were scheduled to fly NBO-LHR on Kenya Airways, then on to the United States on Delta. I am a US citizen and my wife is a Kenyan citizen with a US permanent resident card (aka ""green card"").

All went smoothly until the agent checking paperwork at the gate immediately prior to boarding denied boarding to my wife based on the idea a transit visa was required in the UK, when in fact no transit visa is needed for our situation.

To make matters worse, when my wife returned to the ticket counter for further assistance (as instructed by the gate agent), she was told there was nothing they could do for her and that she would need to purchase an entirely new ticket. She purchased a one way ticket on KLM for $1550.

Of course I immediately filed a complaint with Kenya Airways and insisted on reimbursement. After numerous inquiries into the status of my complaint, and being told an investigation was ongoing, I finally received an email on October 4 in which Kenya Airways admitted the situation was entirely their fault. They offered $300 compensation.

After several more emails back and forth, I've concluded they will never make things right and accepted their $300 offer. It's impossible to argue with an airline headquartered in a developing country with no real consequences for appalling customer service.

Their 787 aircraft are nice (does any airline have a 787 which isn't nice?) but I would stay far away from Kenya Airways. You never know what sort of shenanigans they will pull and there is no way to hold them accountable after the fact.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/1e/7e/c6/jameson-h.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesonh523,Jameson H wrote a review Oct 2018,Jameson H,,2 contributions,1 helpful vote,Nairobi - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r627055606-Kenya_Airways-World.html,"Wife denied boarding for illegitimate reason, horrible customer service",Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Our flight had a tight connection at Amsterdam.

Unfortunately the flight was late leaving Nairobi as apparently they had trouble disconnecting the stairs from the plane. This obviously made our connection even tighter!

Sadly, the staff were extremely unhelpful and at times rude, when we asked for their help.

Firstly, we asked if we could move nearer to the front to help us exit the plane quicker and we were immediately told that there was no space. This was not true as I had already gone up and spoken to 3 people who were all sat on their own in rows of 3!! As they were no help, we chose to just move ourselves about 90 minutes before landing.

We also were blocked by a very rude steward when we tried to walk through Premium economy when we were leaving the aircraft and he said all Premium Economy people needed to exit first. The guests in Premium Economy said that they were happy for us to go first as they would hate to see us miss our connection but he still would not let us go through and even put his arm up to block my partner from moving forward.

When we arrived back in Edinburgh, only 1 of our 3 pieces of luggage was on the flight. We have since received the other two pieces but this was also an inconvenience.

I would have given this 2 stars but the plane was quite comfortable and the food not bad by aeroplane standards.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/43/default-avatar-2020-11.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lou1974Edinburgh,Lou1974Edinburgh wrote a review Oct 2018,Lou1974Edinburgh,Edinburgh,601 contributions,154 helpful votes,Edinburgh - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r626766500-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Poor customer service,Date of travel: October 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My first time on the Boeing 787 “Dreamliner.”  Meh, ho-hum.  No, it doesn’t offer a much different experience than any other big airliner.  Kenya Airways didn’t allow advance seat selection and I got the worst seat on the plane (last row, center seat) even though I had booked weeks in advance.  I will admit the last row seats DO recline, so give the Dreamliner and Kenya Airways cudos for that, it sucks up about 6 valuable inches of cabin space.Cuisine on Kenya Airways is not surprisingly more African style, not bad, just not very European.  Service is charming.Oh here is something only men will notice:  Dreamliner toilet seats don’t stay up by themselves.  Doesn’t Boeing know how to design a proper toilet seat?  You have to hold it up yourself while you are relieving yourself.  That’s a ridiculous juggling act.  Hilarious, though.  Try not to miss.

"Flying with Kenya Airways is testing your luck.
My flight was on time for departure and arrival. The flight crew were friendly, and the service was good. Those are the basic things, all passengers expect this on a trip.
Now the real complains - the planes are old.
The way the pilots did the takeoff and landing of the plane made me really scared.
The arrival was a really hard landing, almost like we dropped on the runway and braked very hard to stop. Almost felt the terrible fear of what can go wrong.

"I can only assume that Kenya Airways must have sourced the cheapest seats possible for their 'flagship' (and reasonably new) Boeing 787 Dreamliners.

Having spent many thousands of hours as an air passenger and having enjoyed all classes of travel from first to 'the back-end' and all classes of carrier from the longhaul premiums to the cheapest 'very-low-cost' and 'bucket-and-spade' brigade, I can honestly say that our first experience of KQ ranks right down there at the bottom of our list!

After 10 hours sitting on what were literally rock-hard seats we couldn't wait to de-plane; we were quite literally numb!

To make matters worse, in general, we found the cabin-crew to be surly and sour-faced (not at all the happy smiling face of Kenya that we normally encounter), and they performed the absolute minimum level of service that was required, and even then did so almost openly hostile!

A very unpleasant experience, and since first impressions count for a great deal (in my book anyway) we most certainly won't be giving KQ the benefit of any doubt in the future...

"I have no criticism of the staff as they were wonderful, polite and helpful. The aircraft was clean and tidy but the leg room was far too tight, I'm only short but felt cramped and could feel cramp setting in. None of the seat reclining buttons worked on the four seats we had both there and back. The inflight selection of movies which are definitely required on a nine hour flight were terrible. The worst selection of B rated films ever. Very disappointing. Additionally the TV Series available to watch were all American sit comms of very poor quality. The inflight catering was very average.

"After the traumas of the passport and security systems at LHR it was lovely to ushered to our sumptuous seats for the flight to NBO. Settled back with drinks and snacks served before take-off, then in the climb kicked back and availed ourselves of the IFE which was extensive. A very smooth flight with dinner and breakfast being served before landing at NBO early in the morning.
A fairly good service but I have two small criticisms to make, firstly that on both outbound and return flights we were seated at the rear of Business Class and failed to get our chosen meal, on the return leg I had a standard meal from the rear galley. Also there are no attendants around the cabin during the middle 4-5hrs of the flight, I had to go looking for a drink of water as we were both getting dehydrated.

We flew twice with Kenya Airways as part of our East Africa safari.  Both flights were late leaving.  We wanted Premium Economy for the 8+ hour flight but they don't offer this option (only Economy or Business).    For the rest of our flights with another airline we did book Premium seats.   Food was not great but at least it was available.  Beverages were served frequently and the service was good (staff were friendly).  My husband's seat recline was broken so he had to sit in upright position for the entire long flight!  Thank goodness there were movies to help pass the time since he couldn't sleep.

"booked a midday flight from Nairobi to Kigali a year in advance on the Kenyan Air website in business class and paid approx $800 per person.  A few months before the flight Kenyan cancelled it and the only viable flight (we had a long drive after landing in Kigali to get to our accommodation) was 7.20 in the morning.  Problem was it was an all economy flight so I had no choice except to accept that.  They refused to give a refund of the difference in fares (roughly $500 pp).  Wasn’t happy at all but accepted it.    Imagine my shock when boarding the plane to find they had changed the equipment to a business + economy, had sold all the seats in business and left us in economy  - just robbery!!

We always take a int holiday once a year and everytime we check for flights out of South Africa the cheapest and most affordable is Kenyan Airways. But family and friends have also given us very bad reviews so my family will never allow me to book Kenyan airways. My husband would always say i rather pay more than use Kenyan airways. Last week however he deiced to spoil me with a short trip to Zanzibar and your airline was the most affordable. I had my reservations i checked reviews on skytrax and i was a bit scared. We actually packed our luggage in a way if our bag got lost we would be ok. I have to compliment your airline was excellant. Flights were on time. Check in was hassle free. Food was brillant just the all round service was excellant. My husband and i were truly shocked at what excellant service you guys offer. Luggage was fine nothing lost.

"I had the option of traveling from Johannesburg to Lagos on SAA economy or business on Kenya airways because SAA business was full. Being a frequently traveller in business class, i chose Kenya airways thinking surely it would be the better option though i had never flown kenya airways.
My experience was horrible from the start with delays on both legs on the journey. The biggest disappointment was the plane. The seat were a milder version of economy seats since they don't have full beds (on both legs)
There was no inflight entertainment (on both legs). The air hostess said something about downloading an app and i could not help my shock at such archaic thinking in this day and age. The choice of drinks was very, very limited. Blankets and pillows in business class were disappointing.
The planes used are best suited for short domestic flights of maybe 30mins to 1hr not for international flights of 3hrs and above. SAA economy is far better at least they have inflight entertainment, more options as per snack and drinks and i would have flown just 5 hrs.
To think that anyone could have enjoyed the trip was delusional to say the least. I couldn't wait to get off the uncomfortable plane.

"The flight was delayed by 50 minutes but we were much longer in the plane, because the boarding was completed efficiently on time. If you ask for a beer or wine, you get 2 cans or small bottles of South African pretty good wine. If you ask for a whiskey, you will get a GOOD glass of it on ice. Mixed nuts are great! Macadamia and cashew! It is not like peanuts on other flights with other airlines. Usually when one of the food options is finished, the second one is bad. In case of Kenya airways, fish was OK.

i was sitting in the seat on plane at heathrow  yesterday (27 sep) and the pilot said on the speakers that there was an electrical problem at the rear of the plane.  I upped and left the plane. Reason was the last flight i was on  from Nairobi was delayed by 4 hours with no information as to why. I know why because i saw electricians going to the back of the plane. They was a electrical fault in the food heaters. All the food had to be replaced.  So i thought here we go again - I'm not sitting on a plane with an electrical fault and i aint sitting for hours waiting for it to be fixed.I have informed the civil aviation authority and they will investigate this. I spent all morning and went to heathrow to be told i would have to pay £300 extra. They deny any reponsibilty for the me leaving the plane. I chose not to take the flight.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnmclester,johnmclester wrote a review Sep 2018,johnmclester,"London, United Kingdom",9 contributions,2 helpful votes,London - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r620288856-Kenya_Airways-World.html,dont fly kenyan airways,Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Kenya Airways is by far the worst airline I have ever had the displeasure of flying with.

They delayed my flight to Dubai while waiting to board. No communication from the Airline, instead we had to find out via our travel app. To make things even worse, after online check in a few mins ago, I received an e-mail from my travel app that my flight back to Johannesburg has been delayed by 2 hours. Once again spur of the moment flight delays, no communication from the airline, absolutelt shambolic service.

I will onviously never fly them again!

"Going on vacation in Kenya we booked with KLM, but ended up on Kenya Airways operated flights. Seemed like an advantage as the KLM flights to and from Nairobi are old Boeing 747s, while the Kenya Airways plantes are pretty new Dreamliners (787s). However they are far from providing a Dream experience.
Seats in Economy feel very hard and stiff with the upright position being extremely upright which kind of forces you to bend your neck. There is quite a lot of recline, which is terrible for the person sitting behind someone, who recline the seat fully. My husband’s knees were repeatedly crushed and I had the entertainment screen 35 from my eyes during a 8 hour flight, where I had to ask the cabin crew request the passanger to put her seat in an more upright position during lunch to be able to eat in a fairly decent position. A very very bad experience.
On the flight back to Amsterdam a chicken bread and a muffin were served together with a glass of water or juice after approximately 1 hour and only after 5 hours into the flight was anything else offered to drink, amd soon after lunch was served. Passengers were starting to collect water themselves in the galley, but it seems far from ideal to have 300 people walking back and forth for something to drink during a flight.
The inflight entertainment is not very interesting. There are maybe a handfull of good movies, but they are not exactly new.
The Dreamliner seems to operate very nicely and is definately not a noisy plane, but all in all the experience flying it with Kenya Airways was not good. We got safely from a to b on time, and this for a considerable amount of money.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/e4/default-avatar-2020-30.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/25bettinap,Bettina Fynholt P wrote a review Sep 2018,Bettina Fynholt P,"Goes, The Netherlands",36 contributions,31 helpful votes,Nairobi - Amsterdam,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r619835392-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Dreamliner “nightmare”,Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

For dinner we were each given a plastic tray with a little bit of rice and stew - no tray, no desert, not even the usual stale bread - just the little hot snack - served with a throw-away coffee pack (plastic teaspoon, sugar and creamer - yip - you ate your beef stew with the plastic teaspoon).

"I actually had two Kenya Airways flights, 8002 from Paris to Nairobi and Flight 4161 from Nairobi to Amsterdam. I was very impressed and pleased with Kenya Airways employees and the plane itself.

The employees are so pleasant and the Pilots' were sort of traditional in that they would make public announcements about the geography of the area we were flying over: such as the Alps area of the French / Italian border, I love this. The flight attendants were attentive, well groomed and well spoken.

The Boeing planes were newer and very clean and the quietness of the flight was endearing. The food rocked! The Artisian Bread combo was really good and the wine was above average in quality.

"I arrived at the airport at 5 am so i could board my flight to Harare leaving Nairobi at 715. Flight KQ706
Upon arriving at the check in desk, I am informed that the flight was overbooked by 30 people and i would need to be put on another flight
I offered to pay extra to upgrade - to no avail. I then accepted to be on KQ704 departing at 1410
A KQ desk attendant called Mary assisted me (good service) quickly, printing out my boarding pass and checking in my bag for the 1410 flight.
She passed me on to William for the compensation and the action whilst i wait for my flight at 1410 (KQ704)
William was struggling with the load of the KQ706 customers that had faced the same problem. There were some very irate people. After about and hour he then assisted me by helping me to get the $50 compensation
He then tells me to go through immigration and look for the KQ desk inside the airport
I did exactly that. At arrival at the KQ desk i was informed that the resolution to my issue was actually a hotel stay up until my flight. However I needed to exit immigration to be assisted. So William had given me wrong instruction.
I asked the ladies at the desk if i could at least stay in the airport and be given seating in the KQ lounge instead of exiting immigration again and they said that they could not give me seating in the priority lounge and my best solution to comfort was the hotel.
I considered this and I did exactly as they recommended as it was still early…730am or so.
I waited in a que at the KQ desk at the arrivals terminal for about 20 minutes. I was finally assisted by the lady who then sent me to the shuttle to go to Summerdale ‘hotel' with a voucher
I boarded the shuttle which was cramped.
I suffered through the traffic. The shuttle had 3 drop offs , Tamarind, Weston and Summerdale.
When we had traveled about 20 minutes the driver stops at a lay-by along Mombasa highway and swops with another driver. That was my first point of worry, but i let it pass.
We continue and in about another 10/15 minutes, the bus starts smoking ( i have a video of this- the video also shows the dingy quality of the bus)…it was smoking from the inside and outside….all the passengers were concerned and we all raised alarm.
The driver just asked people to open the windows and we proceeded
The driver says we should carry on to Tamarind where he would get another bus. Finally boarded bus which arrived at Summerdale Inn (not Hotel as the voucher indicated) at about 930. The Inn is in a horrible looking part of town and looks like a 1/2 star establishment .
Rooms were not ready
We were told to go to breakfast.
At breakfast the food ran out. What was left was off, the bacon had a stench and smell.

KQ responded to my complaint with a long email justifying why they overbook...(because they do not think 30 people will make the flight) and offering me a silly $50voucher.

"I've flown with Kenya Airways a few times now and each time my flight(s) were delayed. The connecting flight to Accra is scheduled to depart at 1am but it seems like nobody told the crew about it... it only leaves at 2am. On my last stopover in Nairobi the flight was delayed because they did not have any crew to operate the flight. It was first delayed by 4 hours and then by a further 10 hours. Only when passengers started to make a scene (after the 2nd delay was announced) did Kenya Airways realise they needed to do something to make it up to their passengers. It took them an hour to get the passengers allocated to hotels and on unroadworthy transport. When arriving at the hotel we were told that the airline did not notify the hotel so it took them a further 2 hours to get rooms available so we could freshen up and take a short nap before getting onto another unroadworthy bus to the airport with signs allover saying you should buckle up but not a single seatbelt available.

The one thing I appreciate most about KQ is the availability of direct flights from Nairobi to the rest of the world- this has really made travelling convenient for those like me who hate numerous connections.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WamburaWM,WamburaWM wrote a review Sep 2018,WamburaWM,"Dar es Salaam, Tanzania",62 contributions,27 helpful votes,Nairobi - Dar es Salaam,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r617828160-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Direct Flights,Date of travel: August 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I'm from Kenya and even a shareholder of Kenya Airways (KQ) and i would love to fly and promote the airline all the time... unfortunately though, i usually only fly it out of convenience due to shorter journey time. Even this may start to reduce further after my last flight. As i climbed on board, the supervising attendant on business class greeted me warmly and said they would try and make my journey a very pleasant one. This all started going wrong immediately after take off - i went to use the washroom and all of a sudden the door behind me opens. One of the attendants opened the door without even giving me a second to respond after knocking... it was ridiculous and thankfully my back was facing him. He never came to even apologize until i raised it with the supervisor later. I'd even let that go... but then it was time for lunch. The starters were served and i waited patiently for my main course. The passenger next to me then tapped me on the shoulder and asked if i had ordered anything and when i said yes, she felt really uncomfortable as she has finished her meal and i was yet to be served - i said it must be taking long but after another 10 mins or so she called the attendants to ask and they had forgotten my meal and said they now had to heat it. 30 mins passed until i called for the attendants again and this time the supervisor came - apologized that they had run out of the option i picked and so were taking one of the crew meals that was the same and needed to defrost and heat that up. All in all i got served over an hour after my fellow passenger was served.
Something else to note is Kenya airways won't serve you champange unless you ask for it when you first board. No water bottles are provided either again until you request for one.
For the price you pay, the value for money and service is sub-standard compared to the likes of Emirates. The skyteam lounges also do not compare to the Emirates lounges.
I may still fly KQ, but it may be more out of convenience... if i don't have to worry about time, i'm definitely sticking to one of the other airlines which has a higher level of comfort, better food and way better service!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ef/9c/default-avatar-2020-14.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pareet_Shah,Pareet_Shah wrote a review Sep 2018,Pareet_Shah,"Nairobi, Kenya",16 contributions,16 helpful votes,Paris - Nairobi,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r617613323-Kenya_Airways-World.html,"Convenient to fly, but business class service standards need a big step up in comparison to other airlines!",Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"This was a Delta code share flight and I tried for weeks via the website and calling customer service to get a seat assignment, to no avail.

At the departure airport (Dulles), I was told I could get my seat at the connecting airport.  At the connecting airport (Paris) I could not get through security without a boarding pass.  Apparently I needed to go outside of security to the Kenya airways check in counter to get my boarding pass.

"I used Kenya Airways for my trip to Mauritius. When returning back from Mauritius, and while collecting my luggage, I found out that my stroller travel bag was damaged. Although I did wrap it and ensure additional protection, the travel bag was damaged at a part where it could not be repaired or even stitches.
Tried to raise a report to the Baggage Services at the Dubai International Airport (in vain) - they did not want to assist in any way and this after waiting for 2 hours for them to give me that answer - “wait Sir, we will try to find a solution”.

Later on contacter Kenya Airways.
They asked me to bring back the travel bag and after more than 10 emails, o have decided to leave it.

I have seen some videos and comments of Baggage Services agents throwing baggage like throwing trash bags.

"I had the privilege of being upgraded for this trip to business class due to the plan being full.

The trip started at the business lounge at JKIA. The lounge is modern and comfortable and offers internet which is not the fastest but it's good enough for light streaming and work. The lounge offered a good variety of drinks and the food also was varied and tasty. The service was awesome despite the high number of travelers inside the lounge. This lounge is definitely 10/10.

The flight was a little bit late about 20 mins which is very very good for Kenya Airways... About 1.5 to 2 years back the norm was 1 hour if you are fortunate and all types of questionable reasons were given.

Once inside the flight was comfortable the food was good and the drinks choice was good. Kenya Airways have really changed for the better.

The only reason they don't quite get a 10 is because the selection of movies was very limiting and the choices of what to eat was also very limiting. They only offered one type of red wine. Apart from that the service was outstanding.

"We flew economy with KA recently. The aircraft was a regular local aircraft (Boeing) making it super cramped for a 6hr long journey. In flight crew was not the most helpful and was almost always grumpy. They served food starting from row 1 and reaching the last unlike most flights where two teams split food distribution starting from first row and a middle row. This means that if you are seated towards the end (which we were) you’ll be served nearly an hour and so after they start serving food. Also they don’t turn off lights for passengers to sleep until really late (credit to the poor food distribution and cleaning setup)!

In-flight entertainment is outdated too.

Only 2 restrooms for the entire economy class for a such a long duration flight. So, you can imagine how clean it would be.

Overall, a boring flight for a journey 6 hr long. I’d avoid it if I have the option next time.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/99/9a/17/sriram-s.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/760srirams,Sriram S wrote a review Sep 2018,Sriram S,,50 contributions,14 helpful votes,Nairobi - Mumbai,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r617498625-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Cramped aircraft and average service,Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Nevertheless my first experience was so great. I enjoyed the food but what I found annoying was their little television set on the seats, geez.

"While travelling to the Seychelles via Nairobi, we arrived in Mahe to find we were amongst approximately 20 travellers whose bags had been PURPSELY left behind in Nairobi because Kenya Airways had decided to use a smaller plane and they couldn’t transfer all the luggage because of ensuing “weight/ space restrictions”. Our bag showed up two days later, which was bad enough, but some travellers were on,y there for 3/4 days so although it spoiled the beginning of our vacation, it ruined those people’s vacations. We were offered $100/ day allowances that we had to pay for and claim back, we’ll see how that goes now we’re back from this vacation. In general, the staff at the airport(s) were helpful, but the fact that an airline can do this on purpose for what can only be a cost-saving exercise, is unprofessional and spoils vacations that people save all year for!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/48/default-avatar-2020-15.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rtwharris2,rtwharris2 wrote a review Sep 2018,rtwharris2,"Lincolnshire, United Kingdom",3 contributions,5 helpful votes,Nairobi - Victoria,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r617155903-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Baggage left behind,Date of travel: September 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The 737 between Cape Town and Nairobi is okay (great food too), but the seats on the dreamliner from Nairobi to Amsterdam are way to small for an 8 hour flight. The breakfast was a spinach pie with some sort of little sausage inside. This in combination with the high temperature on board(especially in the front, same story on the way back!) and the sunheat from outside (these modern windows turn a lovely blue but do NOT reflect the heat!) and 4 typical loud americans on 3 seats in front of me (2 little screaming little princes) almost made me throw up all over the nunn and pastor next to me. Fortunately i could just hold back till I reached the toilets, I needed 2 hours on the jump seat to recover a bit. The biggest problem is that with this airline you are not able to choose your seat. You check in online as soon as this is allowed, 30 hours before departure, but all seats will be crossed out, and you will have to take the seat you are allocated. For someone of 6ft3 this is extremely frustrating. You can call Kenya Airways in Nairobi , London or Amsterdam, nothing will help. Make an account first to start chatting to them worked on the way to Amsterdam to avoid the middle seat, but the aisle seat I wanted was not available anymore. Oh well, at least we got there safely, and we didn't blow a tyre and flew off the runway in Amsterdam, like the previous time I flew them, almost 20 years ago.  The price was good though.

"We chose Kenya Airwavs this year because of a reasonable price and a short waiting time on the Jomo Kenyatta Airport. The plane from Cape Town was only half full which was perfect for us as we were traveling with small kids and had one seat extra for both of them so they had a nice and pleasant flight. The stuff, service and drinks were great,the plane was also clean and tidy. My only complaint goes to the food as it was one of the worst I've ever had on the plan ever. A actually had some serious stomach problems so I would definitely not recommend eating food on the plane.
I would also like to add that when you choose a company like that you can't really expect to get some ""extra"" services like you get on the Emirates or Singapore Airlines with plenty of kids movies and series or with kids toys, blankets, colouring books, itc.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/12/82/ed/5d/logarmihec.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/logarmihec,logarmihec wrote a review Sep 2018,logarmihec,"Cape Town, South Africa",147 contributions,11 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Nairobi,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r616382991-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Pleasant flight,Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Very very disappointed in the disrespectful check in lady Rosinah makhunyane. So I check in Jhb on the 13th of September on kq765 for the weekend to Mombasa. So this rosinah lady asks for yellow fever vaccine and unfortunately I had changed bags and forgotten the card. Mind you I travelled business class and she simply tells me I should just change my travel dates??? That’s all no other alternative!I mean I have traveled many yellow fever vaccine countries and I know you can get the jab from the airport. I Even tell her I recently visited Nigeria and show her the stamp to show her I really just forgot. Only when I ask her that is when she refers me to the airport clinic which am sure she knew was closed by 7pm. She also tells me that they will stop checking in at 23.20 I had got the by 22.10 which was obviously a lie. So I walk to the other end ( very far 20min) to the clinic. Luckily the security at the clinic was so helpful he even organized a cab for me to the nearest 24 hour clinic 5 minutes away at arwyp. Arwyp is actually got a 24 hour travel clinic which were so efficient I was done in10 minutes.

So my complaint is, am sure it's not her first time to come across people who forget tor don't have the vaccine so instead of telling people to cancel flights mind you all the hotel and holiday reservations confirmed and paid... could she not at least assist or tell me about the clinic. It would be shocking if she doesn’t know about the clinic just ouside the airport...Did she want me to bribe her???? I finally get the card, check in then again at the boarding gate am asked to produce and I notice it's only me no one else. Did she just try and jeopardize my trip.

Kindly look into this as I doubt your airline would have refunded me this ticket. She knows who I am as I told her am definitely writing a complaint. Where on this earth does a air steward tell a client to change travel dates because of a yellow fever certificate I had just forgotten.

We arrived at the airport to find that their check in system was down. We waited hours whilst they tried to fix it to no avail - there is nowhere to sit so the plane full of travellers had to stand in the non air conditioned airport. There was little sense of urgency by the staff - everything was done in slow motion! Eventually they had to use manual check in which took ages. We had an onward flight to catch to London so our bags had to be checked through to London. We and other passengers were nervous that our manually logged baggage wouldn’t arrive at the end destination but I have to say we were incredibly impressed when our luggage appeared in London.

"During an extended visit to Madagascar, we heard that Air Madagascar was prone to flight delays or cancellations, but it turns out that our experience with them was far superior to that with Kenya Airways.

Despite paying ~US$1000 apiece for the fairly short hop from TNR to NBO, my wife & I were informed by text message at the last minute (~3 hrs prior to scheduled takeoff) that our flight was cancelled, with no explanation. Given our earlier online research when choosing seats, we suspect that it was because the flight wasn’t very full, but they wouldn’t comment despite being asked directly.

Thus, instead of taking a reasonable mid-afternoon flight, we were put on a 02:40 (very early morning flight), obviously far less desirable. Luckily, we had built in some buffer before our onward international flight, but this essentially trashed our planned overnight stay in NBO.

"I’ve travelled four times on Kenya Airways, the last of which was New Year’s Eve vacation 2017. At first I overlooked the airline as just regular-I guess on economy one looks to the arrival than the journey. But I must say that on all 4 trips, the airline was timely (I had in the past heard to the contrary). The December trip was infact most enjoyable. Leg room! I was on a seat by the emergency exit (try it). The airline stewards looked after us superbly. To this day I still regret recently taking ‘some’ direct airline and forfeiting Kenya Airways which has a via Nairobi to the same destination. Lesson learnt.

"Last 19th July We were flying from Barcelona to Johannesburg. As soon as we were boarding to our next connection in Schipol (from Amsterdam to Nairobi - KQ 117), we were called by the flights attendants.
Before boarding we were asked to show the birth certificate of our children (our children are aged 16, 13 and 10). We showed them our passports along our Spanish family book as well (there the birth certificate of all and everyone of them is stated).
The flight attendant who was ""assisting"" and who also spoke spanish and I think she was of spanish ascent (I think Guatemalan or central amercican) was absolutely unpolite and rude with us right from the beginning and she refused to let us board the plane.
We got absolulety desperate and we tried to reach anyone superior to her in order to let us enter the aircraft.
Even when we were showing our documents to the superior she insisted they were wrong because they were written in spanish (?) and they were not OK.
Finally we were allowed to board from Amsterdam to Nairobi and try to fix everything there in order to proceed to Johannesburg.
Well, our family book was absolutely OK not only in Nairobi but also in Johannesburg. We had no problem at all to enter those countries because it was absolutely correct.

"First the good. Staff are pleasant. Food is good. This is a no frills airline so don't expect additional snacks or toothbrushes etc.
That's it.
Cancelled flights seem to be the norm. Long lines of people at the help desks trying to find out where their flights have gone. The ground crew repeatedly print boarding passes hoping that the flight will magically re-appear,appear!
It seems that they wait until they have enough passengers to fill an aircraft so perhaps it could be a couple of days as some young ladies in front of me found out.

"My husband and I travel extensively and usually only take carry-on size back packs.
However, we had a short hop (one-hour) between Entebbe and Nairobi and were encouraged by the check-in person to check our packs, because the plane was small. What a mistake!!!
We watched as our luggage was tagged and saw it go on the conveyor belt. Mine did not arrive in Nairobi. However, we were told it was scanned in Entebbe. I guess it fell out of the aircraft! I travelled Kenya without anything other than the clothes I wore to fly. It puts a whole new meaning to travelling lite! We also had to change some of our travel plans, like hiking Killi. I'm petite and believer me there is not much available in small and x-small clothing in Kenya.
It is now 4 weeks that my luggage is missing, my file has gone to KQ insurance, however I don't have much faith I'll be reimbursed for the value of my loss. I had no valuables such as money, perfume, alcohol, or electronics in my bag. However, I needed my personal items such as my clothes, I had gifts from Ugandan friends and gifts I had brought for Kenyans friends. (a wedding we were suppose to attend). My pack is sentimental as it's been with me on many adventures. I have combed the internet and other posts here, and it seems that there is corruption within the airline. KQ or airport staff, actually steal from travellers. I'm ok without my possessions, however, I'm not ok with stealing. I'm also a charitable person, but choose who and when I donate.

"My recent experience with KQ was just awful. Both my flight from Johannesburg to Nairobi and from Nairobi to Bangkok were cancelled. In the end I arrived one day later. Flight cancellations and delays happen, I understand, but the way the ground staff handles the situation is completely unacceptable. There is no communication at all, priority member do not get preference, there was a lot of confusion and after spending a long time in the queue at the transfer desk, another long queue at immigration, I couldn't stomach another 1 hour queue so I would get a hotel voucher for Nairobi and decided to find my own hotel. Once back at the airport, there were further delays, and expected arrival times were wrongly communicated. We did get a 200 dollar voucher, but this has to be spent only on KQ flights or luggage and has to be used in the next 6 months.

"I really was impressed with the overall passenger service provided by Kenya Airways. From the cabin crew to the pilot/s, to the ground staff, I found them efficient, friendly & helpful. The cabin attendants' uniforms were impeccable & the female cabin crew had every hair in place & make up perfect. The business class seats in the 737-800 were recliners with foot rests & very comfortable. This aircraft was used from Cape Town to Nairobi. From Nairobi to Schiphol & return, Kenya Airways uses the Dreamliner & in this aircraft the seats are flat bed. Again, the service was excellent. The choice of food from the menu is varied enough for all palates. The fruit served was attractively  presented & of high standard. Lovely South African wine was on offer as also French Champagne. The return journey was on an E190 & I felt that the seating in the business class was of the standard of business class of yesteryear. The seats reclined (slightly) no foot rest. I had a glitch on my return flight. Kenya Airways customer care services replied in detail to my letter to them & didn't try to ""pass the buck"" but thanked me for my feedback & would pass on my comments to the relevant departments for ensuring that my ""glitch"" would not recur.

Once on board the departure happened with an hour delay without any explanation except from a promise by the captain we would arrive on time (which we did). Only airborne we heard a few pax had to be removed from the airplane and their luggage had to be offboarded.

"On July 30 our group of 5 flew from Nairobi to Entebbe International Airport via KQ572 flight was delayed for 1 hours. When we arrived at Entebbe our 4 out of 5 bags did not arrived with us. There were other 25 passengers that did not get their bags. We have to go for Gorillas Trekking in Bwindi without cloth for changes including my trekking shoes. We stayed in Uganda for 4 days without our luggages. Our tour agent has to followup with them every day until August 2 when we need to catch flight from Entebbe to Kilimanjaro via Nairobi.We got our bags to check in on that day. So we took two dresses with necessary things for our two nights stay in Tanzania. We don't trust them any more. The flight from Entebbe-Nairobi-Kilimanjaro was delayed from Entebbe to Nairobi for 2 hours as a result we missed our connecting flight from Nairobi to Kilimanjaro at 17:50. They put us in the late flight that left Nairobi to Kilimanjaro at 22:55 (they plan to put us on another flight that will leave Nairobi at 23:55 but get to Kilimanjaro at 3:10 am. We declined to take that flight). And again when we got to Kilimanjaro 4 out of 5 bags didn't arrive at Kilimanjaro again.this time we're prepared and we get our bags on August 4 when we check in for flight to Nairobi and back to Bangkok. Surprised our bags arrived at Suvannabhum International Airport with us.

"Flight took off without a hitch and on time....we reached cruising altitude in no time and food was served

Normally I would think on a 5+ hour flight, some in-flight entertainment would be provided - not in this case...

The flight took off and arrived in Nairobi with only the hum of the engines to keep us company

Cabin crew were however very pleasant and quite professional

I've been on previous Kenya airways flights and their service is second to none, but this time, they fell way short

Perhaps the route prohibits in-flight entertainment (🤔) or perhaps, there was a slight problem

I quickly went online to see if there was an earlier flight on any airline.  Turns out there was a 10:50 direct flight on Precision Air.  I asked the ground staff about that flight...as it does not take a rocket scientistwould rather get to Arusha at midnight verse 3am. They said ""that flight is Precision Air"". I actually had to say ""and who runs Precision Air?""  When she responded ""Kenya Airways""...I just looked at her...and thankfully the lightbulb slowly came on and she then asked if I would like to take that flight.  Where is the common sense that I would prefer to get to my destination 3 hours earlier, especially late at night.  My son finished the climb a day early, so I called to get my return moved a day earlier.  The change price quoted was more than it would cost to just buy new tickets online.  How is that  possible?  So, I bought new tickets online to Dar and took a different airline home.  Think about that...at that point, I would rather pay more money to fly home on a different airline.  Seriously, I would rather pay more money to NOT fly on Kenya airline.I wrote in a complaint.  21 days later they responded only to ask for copies of my tickets.  I responded with my booking reference. 30 days later they asked for my tickets.  I sent them all my invoices with multiple flight and ticket references.   They will close the case and call it a win.  I do not expect to hear back.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/de/0a/default-avatar-2020-35.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patrickwmccabe,patrickwmccabe wrote a review Aug 2018,patrickwmccabe,"Johannesburg, South Africa",1 contribution,,Johannesburg - Arusha,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r601883986-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Never fly them again,Date of travel: June 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Checking in at Nairobi was very difficult, too little people to assist witch checking, I had to wait long in the que.

"A good airline for economical travel, especially from Zimbabwe to Nairobi to take connecting flights. Although the Airline does its best in catering as well as ground handling. Once we had an issue of missing baggage and the ground staff did their best in locating and getting it to us by the next flight.
The Airport (Nairobi) disappoints you, especially if you have a long-break, it can be very boring as well as lots of mosquitoes to keep you busy. Keep a mosquito repellant handy, if you are travelling KQ and there is a long stop over at Nairobi. Otherwise, no issues with the airline.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/451blaise_32,451blaise_32 wrote a review Jul 2018,451blaise_32,"Nagpur, India",30 contributions,12 helpful votes,Victoria Falls - Nairobi,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r600949538-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Good Airline,Date of travel: July 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Traveling around Africa generally can cost a lot, both in time and money.  The ticket price will be high, the travel time long, be very expensive, and most times you have to leave the continent to travel from one country to the other.  Luckily, there are African companies that are making travel within Africa more affordable and convenient; both Ethiopian Airlines and Kenya Airways.  Both are the flag carriers of their respective countries, both seem to have updated fleets, good schedules, and both seem reliable.  I was looking to travel from Nigeria to Tanzania, and return from Rwanda back to Nigeria and in looking at my options both Ethiopian and Kenyan came up in the search.  Both were competitive in price and both had about the same overall travel time, but I choose Kenya Airways for a couple of options: 1) I had flown Ethiopian on my way into Nigeria so wanted to try another airline; 2) it had been about 4 years since I had flown Kenyan so wanted to see what updates were available; 3) the departure timings for Kenyan were better; and 4) Kenya had more options in terms of flight scheduling. Booking travel with Kenya was very easy through the website.  The site was easy to book and manage your reservation.  I had to make some modifications to my reservation and that could not be accomplished online, so they either have a chat function available or a call center; both of which were helpful.  Another good feature about Kenya is that they offer refunds on your ticket – if your schedule changes and you need to cancel your ticket, you can ask for a refund instead of travel credit.  The refund amount depends on your ticket and class of service, but everything is available online and usually the refund is processed within 4-6 weeks.  A great service from Kenya.After booking my flight, I managed my reservation through the Kenya Airways app.  Through the app and website I was able to preselect my seats for free, request a special meal, and add my Skyteam frequent flyer number.  I was also able to check-in and print my boarding pass directly from the website 24-hours prior to my departure.  My first flight was from Lagos to Dar Es Salaam via Nairobi.  The Lagos to Nairobi sector was scheduled to depart Lagos at 10:45p and arrive into Nairobi at 6:05am, and then I had 45 minutes to connect to my other flight which was scheduled to depart Nairobi at 6:55am and arrive into Dar Es Salaam at 8:20am.  This was a tight connection, but this is what Kenya Airways provided me and everything was booked on one ticket so I went ahead with it and hoped for the best.  The first flight was operated by a Boeing 737-800 with a 3-3 seat configuration.  The aircraft operates the Nairobi to Lagos sector, and the same planes brings passengers back to Nairobi.  The incoming aircraft arrived late, and the turnaround time was slow, thus boarding began well past the 10pm which was listed on the boarding pass.  Boarding was done by groups and the groups were strictly enforced; this made for a lengthy and delayed boarding to an already delayed flight.  First impressions upon entering the aircraft were good, as it looked like a new-ish plane with updated seats and personal PTV for each seat.  Each seat also contained a blanket, a pillow, and headphones on them.  The seat pitch was decent, not too tight but not too generous either (I am 6’1 and while my knees were not hitting the back seat, there wasn’t tons of room either) and the seat comfort was also average (it was fine for a 3hr flight but there needed to be more comfort for the longer flights).  Each seat contained a PTV with a USB port and headphone jack, a tray table, and then a seatback pocket with the airline magazine, the duty free, and an airsickness bag.  The doors finally closed, we pushed back for the gate, and headed to the runway for the 5hr 20mi flight to Nairobi.Kenya Airways is a full service airline so complimentary meals and drinks are provided.  Once we reached cruising altitude, the meal and drink service commenced.  The special meals were delivered at the same time as the regular meal, and for the regular meal there was an option between two choices.  I had ordered a special meal and while I appreciate being served a meal (as these days meals are disappearing from economy), the quality of the meal was not that good.  It was a decent quantity, not too much food but not too light either (perfect for a 4hr flight) but the quality of the food definitely need to be improved.  Complimentary soft drinks, tea, and coffee were also provided.  Once the meal service ended, passengers sat back and watched their screens.  The PTV screens were already on once you sat down, so most passengers just watched the entertainment program the entire flight.  There was a decent selection of TV shows and movies, again good enough for a 3-4 hour flight but you would get bored on longer flights.    Even though we departed late, we landed roughly on time and taxied to the gate.  There is a separate line for transferring passengers, but because Kenya is starting new flights to the U.S. they have modified the transit so all passengers must go through enhanced screening.  While I understand the security of this, it adds time to the transit process and this needs to be factored into the connection time they provide to customers.  There was a HUGE line of passengers in the transiting security line and it looked like I was going to miss my connection when the airline itself started to call out passengers for my flight.  A representative was pulling passengers and putting them ahead of the security line as I only had a total of 25 minutes to make my connection.  Since I was moved to the front, I went through security and ran to my gate in time to make it to my flight.The second flight was operated by an Embraer 190 with a 2-2 seat configuration.  While the plane size was small, the seat pitch and comfort were nice and each seat had its own PTV screen as well as USB port.  The plane was only half full so the doors closed and we pushed back for an on-time departure.  Since there were not that many passengers, I was able to move up and stretch out to a row unto myself.  Even though the flight time was 1hr30min, a light breakfast was served just after take-off.  The breakfast consisted of a fresh croissant which was nice, warm and fresh.  It was small but it was nice and that is something I appreciated from Kenyan, especially on this short flight.  Tea, coffee, and complimentary drinks were also served with the meal.  Once the meal service end, most passengers either slept or watched the entertainment system.  The system was not as extensive as the system of my Lagos to Nairobi flight, but there was a decent selection of TV shows to pass the short flight time.  We soon landed in Dar Es Salaam and luckily my bags also made the tight connection in Nairobi.My return flight was scheduled differently than my outbound flight.  I was returning from Kigali to Lagos via Nairobi, and I had scheduled a long layover in Nairobi.  My flight was scheduled to depart Kigali at 8:30am and arrive into Nairobi 12:35pm, and I was then going to connect to my flight departing Nairobi at 6:35p and arriving back into Lagos at 9:50pm.  The first flight was operated by an Embraer 190 and has a stop in Bujumbura.  The flight was supposed to board at 7:45am, but that came and went without any announcements.  Finally, the announcement was made and we boarded the plane.  This plane looked similar to the plane that I had taken from Nairobi to Dar Es Salaam, with the same legroom, the same individual PTV’s on each screen, and the same 2-2 configuration.  The flight time from Kigali to Bujumbura was only 45 minutes so most passengers past the time watching their screens.  The passengers on the plane consisted of passengers flying from Nairobi to Bujumbura (who stopped in Kigali); passengers flying from Kigali to Bujumbura; passengers flying from Bujumbura to Nairobi; and passengers flying from Kigali to Nairobi (who stopped in Bujumbura).  We landed at Bujumbura, where some passengers got off while others got on, and set off for Nairobi.  Since this was a longer flight, at 1h55m, both a beverage service and a meal service were provided.  The flight was uneventful and we landed in Nairobi close to on-time.After a scheduled delay, I fought my way through Nairobi traffic to connect to my 6:35p flight to Lagos.  Even though we had boarding groups assigned to us, these were not enforced and everyone boarded as they pleased.  The operating aircraft was a Boeing 737-800, the same aircraft that brought me from Lagos to Nairobi.  The layout was the same, the seat pitch and seat comfort were the same, and again each seat had their own PTV screen.  As this was my fourth flight with Kenyan in the span of two weeks, I had basically exhausted the entertainment options by this point.  As the flight time was 5hr15m, after takeoff a meal and beverage service were provided.  For the rest of the flight, the attendants were not present at all until it was time to get the aircraft ready for landing.  They attendants did not come by with water or to pass through the cabin to collect trash; the attendants just sat in the back talking.  After a bit of a delay, we finally landed in Lagos a bit behind schedule.Overall, it was a decent experience with Kenya Airways.  Since my last experience with them, some aspects have improved while others have stayed the same.  They definitely have a better on-board product versus what they previously had, and that makes for a better inflight experience.  The food quality still is average, and the overall customer service still needs to be improved.  I had some great flight attendants and great customer service, and I had some really apathetic ones.  I would not hesitate to fly them again, but I would just keep my expectations manageable.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/05/ec/ef/5f/0504traveller.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0504Traveller,0504Traveller wrote a review Jul 2018,0504Traveller,"Kenner, Louisiana",4878 contributions,498 helpful votes,Lagos - Dar es Salaam,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r600610990-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Decent flight within Afirca,Date of travel: April 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Your seat is old and worn out and the reclining mechanism is not working properly. And you have paid for a business class ticket! This should not be happening in the 21st century. Not the first time this has happened. Same thing for the Nairobi to Lagos flight. 5 hours in economy class and again no in-flight entertainment.

"What a steal! With Qatar not being an easy/affordable option for UAE residents anymore, we tried Kenyan Airways for the first time.

"We were seated right towards the back of the plan, on a flight that lasted a good 8 hours+. We were served breakfast at 11am although we took off at 4am by flight attendants that lacked an English vocabulary. After waiting for over 30 mins whilst others were served breakfast we were served ours, something called poached eggs, containing a mere serving of stone cold potato wedges on a slurry of sauce beside another stone cold, hard lump of egg. They'd ran out of the other options by the time they got to us, some might even say food, as what we were served was barely edible and left many passengers hungry. At 4:30pm we were served our lunch which was similarly revolting. Once again they served us last leaving us with beef, which once again was cold and practically uneatable. Other passengers received choices between: vegetarian, chicken or beef, whilst my vegetarian sister didn't.

"In an attempt to restore my faith in the airlines and pursuant to a previous complaint, I reluctantly booked Kenya airways for myself, husband and three little kids. Horrible delays and pathetic attempts at conflict resolution left us frustrated, exhausted and arriving at our destination 26 hours later. Kenya staff at DXB blatantly lied to all 38 South African passengers onboard assuring us that our connection flight would not be missed. Zero attempts were made to ensure that we were put on the next available flight after our flight had already departed. Zero attempts were made to ensure providing even a little comfort for us whilst we endured a lengthy wait for our new connection flight. No compensation offered for their mistakes and delays. Staff were indifferent to our frustrations and had no way of dealing with any of our concerns.

"Save for a tinge of patriotism, traveling KQ lately is a complicated, complex and somewhat painful decision and endeavor - for several reasons:
1. Getting through their SA offices is a near impossibility. I had to try their Embakasi helpline to get the assistance I needed.
2. Their revised baggage policy which allows a passenger one (1) checked in luggage is a rip-off. KQ has to make up it mind whether it wants to become a modern passenger airline or it wants to be a cargo airline with passengers being a side hassle.

"Booked a flight months in advance from Mombasa to Nairobi at 5 pm. Was leaving the country with another airline at 10:20 pm the same day. The evening before the flight I checked in on-line and showe up at the airport two hours before take-off. At that point I was asked if I was flying at 9 pm. When I said no I was informed that my flight at 5 pm had been cancelled. I got no e-mail and no sms telling me so. I was told to wait as a superviser would look into my case, if I could get a flight with a ""sister airline"" (Jamboair or something like that). While I waited I saw that the airline 540 was leaving to Nairobi at 5:20. After waiting for half an hour without hearing from that supervisor I complained and demanded to know if I could get a flight with that sister airline - because if that was not an option I would pay for another ticket with 540. The people at Kenya airways were unable to tell me if I could get on the sister airline flight, they just told me that I would be on standby there. Because of that I wanted my money back so I could just book another flight with 540 (the same price, about 9000 Ksh). But that was impossible, they said. But getting that answer took so long that the 540 flight was about to take off, and it was too late to get on board. After about 2 hours I was finally told that I could get a flight with Jamboair, so I did make it. But this was not a pleasent experience. I flew with them from Mombasa to Kisumu and back earlier during that same visit and the flight to Kisumu was an hour and a half delayed, no reason given.  So I would not rely on Kenya airways. Cancelling the flight last minute without any notification like that is unacceptable and highly stressing. And they call themselves the pride of Africa.

"One of the things that I really like about this airline is their facility which allows passengers to bid for an upgrade to Business Class.  My bid was successful and I flew Economy between Johannesburg and Nairobi (this was a relatively short flight anyway)  and then Business on the long-haul sectors between Nairobi and Bangkok.The aircraft was the Dream Liner (on all sectors) and it was clean and comfortable.  The crew were superb, food was good and in-flight entertainment was totally up to date.My only gripe was a technical delay in Nairobi (not the first I have experienced there), which delayed the onward flight to Bangkok from 23h59 to 06h05.  I was relatively comfortable in the Business Class Lounge but Economy passengers must have spent a very uncomfortable night on the plastic chairs in the departure hall, where everything had closed down.Having said that, the airline kept their promises about the new departure and arrival times.  The crew was extremely attentive and the flight was very pleasant...And, let's face it, I would rather have a technical delay at the airport than develop a problem in mid-flight.My return flights from Bangkok to Johannesburg were totally trouble free and I landed in Johannesburg a little ahead of schedule.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/06/ab/0a/c2/bryan-a.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/639bryana,Bryan A wrote a review Jul 2018,Bryan A,"Johannesburg, South Africa",84 contributions,90 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Bangkok,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r596588036-Kenya_Airways-World.html,"Great Airline, Good Service but a technical delay spoiled the experience",Date of travel: June 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Delta said they couldn’t do anything because Kenyan Airways is not in their group of airlines.  Our comfort seats were cancelled with the change. Kenyan Air said I could not upgrade, because they do not offer comfort level in Economy.

"So I booked for my wife and kids to come visit me from South Africa. My daughter was going to fly here first. 4 hours before departure we are notified her flight is cancelled. Alternative is a flight departing in 2 hours. What a scramble, but we made it.

Wife and som made it here, but be warned of a midnight layover in Nairobi. They switch the country's lights off ar 10PM.

So my daughter was supposed to leave this morning. The itenary is a 2:30 layover in Nairobi. Without notifying us, the second leg gets changed to a 10 hour layover. A girl on her own, I think not. We phone and they change her to a day later, flying with wife and son. Great service we think, untill now, with 11 hours to departure, and my daughter's second flight disapears from her itenary. Friday night and no one answering phones or mails.

"I had recently travelled by Kenya airways from Dubai to Accra, Ghana and back to Dubai, via Nairoby, Kenya. I had a low expectation about the flight, inflight service as well as ground staff. But to my surprise, it was all wrong.

The flight from Dubai to Nairoby was widebody Boeing 787-800, with flat bed seats. Very cordial staff.
Nairoby to Accra was narrowbody Boeing 737-800. Though not comfortable as 787-800, it was reasonably good. I was informed that all the international, outside African flights from Nairoby, they use, 787-800 with flat bed seats in busiess class and narrow body for inter African flights.
However, during my return journey, both legs (Accra-Nairoby and Nairoby-Dubai) were narrow body aircrafts.

I had a long layover at Nairoby during my return journey. And I was offered hotel accommodation.
The experience was terrible at the airport immigration. According to the information I got from some of our staff flew on the same flight a few days before, was taken out from the arrival and gave accommodation.
I had to wait in the immigration for about and hour and a half, pay US$ 20.00 for a transit visa. Went to the Kenya Airways counter who arranged accommodation. It was quite slow.
I was offered stay at Four Point Sheraton and had a wonderful experience in the hote too.

"I chose to fly with Kenya airways for my vacations to Mahe islands, Seychelles. Kenya airways operates daily 2 flights to BOM -KQ205 & KQ211. The inbound (KQ205) aircraft 5Y-CYD was late into BOM by 37mins. I was little surprised (and more nervous) because of the fact that my connection in NBO for SEZ (KQ250) was only 50mins- which could have possibly gone!
B737NG of kenya airways comes with 16 premier seats and 129 standard economy seats. The aircraft was newish with spotless cabin, clear flight deack announcements and fortunately also had next generation sky interiors. Seats were well upholstered and had well worn cusion and a blanket. Before we were about to pushback, I had a word with pilots and asked me for a cockpit visit in non critical phase of flight.
After being warmly welcomed by the Flight attendants i was delightfully guided towards my seat. Soon flight deck announcements started and we were ready for the pushback. Soon after takeoff from RWY27, wet tissues were given and south indian breakfast was served. It tasted good when compared with other inflight breakfast I had in past. Cabin crew was efficient and worked smoothly without fuss. Later after the breakfast drinks were served. It included Soda, wine ,beer, tea, coffee with handful variety of juices to choose from. I chose Fresh Apple. In-flight entertainmaint worked well but the headphones had defective left earpiece. I was then given another one.
Soon after that cabin crew asked me a cockpit visit. As I entered the cockpit Capt. Simon masau greeted me and said ""We dint forget you yaa!"" This was something so good of them. Later my journey was commensed on the jumpseat. I had a great time with Capt Simon and F/O Kalya Glenn. We cruised at 34,000ft and landed at NBO with a delay. soon after I had to rush to my connecting flight gate.

"10/10 service. My daughter wasn’t wel. A flight attendant by the name of Mr. KIKWEO was very kind and attentive.

He went above and beyond to make sure she was well taken care of. She wasn’t feeding well. He was kind enough to bring an extra meal just for her to eat one more sausage as well as made hot chocolate for the breakfast.

As if that was not enough, he made a point to serve her before the rest for lunch. This gave me time to concentrate feeding her first.

Kenya airways is never on time, the staff is very arrogant and never provides a proper response to its customers and they are just not bothered about their customers. By virtue of having almost a monopoly in the East African region they have developed a no care attitude.
Inflight service too is very mediocre and the inflight cabin crew too is very impolite and do not respond well to their customer needs.

"Kenya Airways is one interesting Airline. I may be a little bit biased towards this airline I like it despite some little shortcomings I will share this shortly, Checking in online was a-okay straightforward, boarding pass ready and flight departure on time, the crew efficient. This is Kenya Airways, this is one of the early morning flights and breakfast is served and we are quickly enjoying the flight with service done in no time, and with loads time to enjoy the rising sun, we get a lovely sneak peek at the snow-capped mt. Kilimanjaro we crave for a little distraction from the in-flight entertainment screens but today is not our lucky day, some of the units are not working. It is not too bad it, allows me to catch up on my reading till Livingstone, Zambia. Now after the Aircraft was cleaned we are taking off and the Captain (Mashasha Muchiri) and his team treat us to the most spectacular view of the Victoria falls a 360º fly by, YOU CANNOT BEAT THIS, forget the in-flight entertainment it was awesome the Victoria falls are awesome but when you get to fly by over the falls from above its beyond words, I recommend if you are flying to Cape Town, Kenya Airways would be best choice.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/09/f5/83/xabrahamali.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xabrahamali,xabrahamali wrote a review Jun 2018,xabrahamali,"Nairobi, Kenya",38 contributions,5 helpful votes,Nairobi - Cape Town Central,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r588338608-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Kenya Airways goes to Cape Town,Date of travel: June 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Final straw is Mary who has just contacted me. She is the first person in a senior position to attend to me after requesting such assistance several times. I've had to explain my situation several times to numerous people at the airlines only to be met with similar disappointing service. I'm hoping that Mary will restore my faith in the airlines.

"As I always do I watch for the opening time of the online check in and then change my seat to a more preferred location. This worked well for the CPT NBO sector but that is where it ended. I could not check in for my onward flight KQ8520 NBO EBB and eventually gave up frustrated that I had to go to the airport to drop off my bag ahead of the flight without a boarding pass for my final leg.
The Kenya Airways staff at the airport in CPT were helpful but also defeated, unable to offer any explanation why they too were unable to check me in for my final leg.
The flight then left on time, positive and eventually reached Nairobi 45 minutes early, a life saver for me to make my connecting flight which was taking off from a different terminal making an endless walk necessary.
But first things first ... In my meal did I find a piece of plastic in the slice of cake, kept it for the crew, handed it to them and it was taken without any apology or regret. I hope it was reported after landing because that should not happen unless for careless catering staff and poor quality control.

Transit in Nairobi was a nightmare for me ...

First, arrival security control at JKIA had ONE, yes ONE station operating and the queue kept growing and growing by the minute, of departing passengers from Nairobi being screened alongside more connecting passengers from flights just landed. By the time I reached the front of the queue three other stations had just opened, and of course those coming last were served first causing audible curses and comments from those who had stood in line for long.
Next, in addition to the regular and often mind boggling stuff one sees at security checkpoints, I was asked to remove my scarf, which in the worst of scenarios did not resemble a weapon and anything of metal below would have been captured by the scanner. Well, given the short fuse security agents have these days and the gusto with which they bundle objecting passengers to interrogation cells for strip searches had me bite my tongue but I think my face told him what fate I wished upon him.
Finally through, my scanned scarf once again tied around my neck I was able to get to the transfer desk of Kenya Airways. There, after enduring another lengthy wait, I was then told upon brief inspection of my itinerary print that I should proceed to Gate 5 as the lady at the KQ counter ‘could not help’ to get me a boarding pass. Pointing at the KQ flight number did not help either but prompted her to say one revealing and one outright s***** thing: One was that their systems are not aligned and she could see my booking on the KQ system but but could not act on it as she had no access to the Jambojet system. Second I was told that Jambojet was wearing pink while Kenya Airways was wearing red uniforms which showed they were different and could I now move to make space for other customers queuing behind me.
I reached Gate 5 after a mile long trek through the entire next terminal, exactly half an hour before departure – and had KQ 785 not landed 45 minutes early I would have reached Gate 5 only after the flight had been closed.
The Jambojet staff, when hearing the story, apologised for the inconvenience of not getting a boarding pass on check in or at the KQ transfer desk, apologized for the long walk and then, lo and behold, I had to go through another security check?!? Thank you but no thank you JKIA and KAA, this was as pathetic as it comes!
Same routine with laptop out, again, shoes off, again, pockets emptied, again and belt buckle removed, again BUT, no one bothered with the weapon of mass destruction around my neck, aka scarf, this time … so much for consistency and training of those deployed to operate the checkpoints.
On board of Jambojet, notably no life vests but a demonstration of how to use the seat as a flotation device, again having me thing of the unthinkable, when the passengers are busy first dismantling their seats before they could escape out of a sinking plane …
And, of course, full fare ticket notwithstanding, I was asked to pay for tea and a snack which on a proper KQ service would have been included in my fare for a flight on the same sector.
My conclusion, never again a codeshare combination which involves Jambojet and for a long time no return to KQ as long as I can avoid them.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/14/55/29/4f/safariafficionado.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Safariafficionado,Safariafficionado wrote a review Jun 2018,Safariafficionado,"Kampala, Uganda",3100 contributions,490 helpful votes,Cape Town Central - Entebbe,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r588204660-Kenya_Airways-World.html,The code share between Kenya Airways and their subsidiary Jambojet is made in hell,Date of travel: June 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Let me start by qualifying the 'average' for seats, legroom and inflight entertainment. This is entirely due to TripAdvisor's continued apathy and inaction to introduce a 'Good' column as an in between of average and very good ... Were there a 'Good' column to tick, I would ... all else was average though ... As always I started my trip prep with an online check in right when it opened up, which worked well for the EBB NBO sector but then let me down as for the NBO CPT sector I could not change the seat, indicating 'full house' but on boarding in Nairobi it turned out there were plenty of spare seats. The crew did not permit a seat change saying that seat could be taken by a passenger boarding in Livingstone but even out of Livingstone were there quite a lot of empty seats so I was just shaking my head. Breakfast service on the EBB NBO sector was prompt and friendly, the meal service to  Livingstone slowish and drinks, in particular tea, was served very late by a crew which did their job but that is where it ended.

"My friend and I flew with Kenya Airways from London Heathrow to Entebbe via Nairobi. It was our first time flying with them, and the leg room and value for the flight is what sold it to us.
On the day of the flight we received a text at 2am telling us our flight had changed to 11:30am - it was originally planned for 6pm. This was then followed by another text which told us it was actually delayed to 8pm. Then followed by a few other texts telling us our connection was delayed then it was not delayed - in the end the 2 hour delay resulted in us having 25 minutes to catch our connecting flight.
Boarding time was 6:30pm, we didn't get on the plane til 7:45pm - there was no explanation to why the plane was originally delayed and followed by another delay. Once on the plane, it was followed by another 1 hour delay due to 2 passengers missing and having to remove their luggage. Finally took off about 9pm which resulted in us missing our connecting, however this was delayed too and once we got to Nairobi there was a quick smooth process. We were handed our new boarding passes soon as we got through security and guided to the right gate.
The plane has very good leg room and we were on the dreamliner which was a new plane - the windows have the new tinted option instead of blinds. However, my headphone output was not working so I could not watch any of the limited in-flight entertainment provided. The food was very basic and was still hungry afterwards. The flight attendants didn't check up on passengers during the flight either.
HOWEVER, even though my flight out was a bad experience and very frustrating the flight home was much better. Everything was on time, smooth process and we even landed 35 minutes early. Plane was comfortable, got given baby wipes once we setlled. 2 hot meals, a snack and plenty of drinks throughout the journey! The other good thing is you get snacks on the short internal flights as well, flight from Nairobi to Entebbe is less than an hour and we were provided croissant and yoghurt!

"The boarding experience in Nairobi is not so pleasant as the staging area where all the passengers gather before boarding is not well lit as well as pretty suffocating. However the plane is good, the seats are quite OK for a person like me. Despite of my 6 feet height the leg room is OK. The air crews are very competent and hard working and cater with a smile on their face. The in-flight entertainment option are very good but i can not say the same for the headphones. The meal service was prompt and the food was hot and delicious. The coffee and the tea was little on the stronger side for my taste.

"After boarding late and having been given no information whatsoever as to what had caused the delay, the passengers were allowed to board the flight (by this stage an hour and 40 minutes late) We were then informed over the tannoy system by the captain that due to ""technical difficulties"" we would be taking off in a further 45 minutes. Once airborne things then went from bad to worse. The in-flight meal was served with no knives, even though it involved beef, bread and butter. The in-flight entertainment might just as well have not been there, as none of the passengers were supplied with headphones. When My neighbouring passengers and myself requested a further drink we were informed that we had to go to the rear of the plane and ask. When we did this, 2 male stewards were fast asleep! I managed to get this on my phone camera, upon which one of the said stewards followed me back to my seat, getting confrontational and demanding to see the picture. I told him I would be reporting to his employer and he walked off muttering to himself. Finally, the coffee that was served prior to descent, was, unbelievably served with the knives, salt and pepper that was missing from the main meal!!

"Over the years, my experience of entering a KQ flight after a hot and tiring day in a difficult place in Africa has been to feel the generosity and welcome I associate with Kenya. I settle into my seat and feel I am at home...or at least being taken good care of on my way there. This is a view shared by many people I know.
Whilst in no way can I suggest that this flight was bad, I didn't get the sense of excellence that I am used to. Could it be that flights to West Africa are not so special?

"I flew from Lagos to Nairobi on the night flight KQ 535 . I was a Good card Holder and a very regular passenger in Kenya Airways flights across Africa mostly. My seat was 11A and the aircraft was so old, the left arm rest on my seat was damaged , he leather cover was completely disconnected. I complained once I.sat down and they got a technician to fiddle with it a bit, not much.was achieved.

On Eventual take off, the aircraft was so noisy and made it difficult to hear anything clearly in the head phones provided. So watching the poor quality movie shown on the central screen was almost impossible.

That was the worst international flight I had ever experienced . Kenya Airways should please.stop using that match box (Boeing 737 - 800 )to fly to Nigeria. More so , not such an Old equipment. It smacks of a total disregard for the volume of passengers flying the airline and connecting to Dubai and Many parts of Asia.

Thanks.

"This has got to be the worst airline I have ever flown. They told my friend and I that we had to pack for our second checked bag, which was reasonable. Then, they said that they wouldn’t take any currency other then USD. They also couldn’t take Visa. These seemed absolutely ludicrous to me. When I tried to give her a $59 dollar bill she stated she didn’t have change. When I finally was able to find change to give her the 30 dollars to the extra bag, she found me at the gate 30 mins later and accused me of giving her FAKE money. By this point there had been so many other issues at the airport it wasn’t worth the fight and I was defeated. I walked with her to the bank so that she could exchange the money and I went on my way. Then the flight was 90 mins delayed so we missed our connecting flight in Nairobi. We then had to stay over night and wait for the first flight out the next day. The wait for the shuttle and hotel process was awful and all of the staff were very rude.

"Kenya Airways has made drastic improvements on it's long haul flights. I was impressed with their business class service on my trip to Dubai in 2017. The customer service on board was exceptional and professional, totally unexpected.

Their domestic flights however, leave much to be desired. With their aging aircraft, weird noises and sounds can be discomforting at times, however, knowing they are the rattling of latches and trolleys, you feel a little relieved. Their on time performance isn't the best, unless the coincidence of travelling with them has left almost every flight delayed by at least 20 mins, if not more.

Phone service and knowledge is below standard. Mombasa customer service at airport - they seem clueless. In fact, I taught them a couple of things which after checking their end, agreed that the information I gave them was accurate. Quite frustrating when they argue with you at the airport refusing to check bags to the final destination when an interline agreement between them and another carrier clearly exists (and transit point is Nairobi out, not first point of entry into a country).

Bottom line, they have improved their on-board service, but leave much to be desired with ground/customer service staff.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MNKafe,Muhammad Nazir K wrote a review May 2018,Muhammad Nazir K,"Mombasa, Kenya",39 contributions,5 helpful votes,Mombasa - Dubai,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r583596399-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Good Improvement,Date of travel: June 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Traveling a lot, I was very excited and curious at the same time of what to experience with my first flight on Kenya from Dubai to Johannesburg ( via Nairobi). It makes 4 sectors. As a reference, I will just talk about Dubai - Nairobi, and Nairobi - Dubai  ( not that other sectors were bad, on the contrary! ).The dreamliner for both night flights were super comfortable, the cabin was clean but what I will always remember is how AMAZINGLY classy, professional, friendly and careful the entire crew was! So rewarding! Chapeau to Kenya Airways for that!! Both breakfast and dinner ( on the way back ) offered a very nice choice with nice food and a large selection of wine. I would have definitely rated both flights 5/5 had the dinner been a 4-course meal instead of 3... cheese would have been so much appreciated ...   a 4.5 / 5 is for sure more appropriate!

"When looking into flight options from London to Livingstone open jaw back from Lusaka to London, Kenya Airways was by far the best price so good value for the journey made. They allow complimentary preallocation of seats which is a big plus as very few airlines still offer this. Online check-in can be done 30 hours prior to departure.

Dreamliner was a little disappointing, felt rather cramped. There are no window blinds and the controls underneath did nothing. I found the Embraer 190 much more spacious with leather seats and more legroom, perfect for the shorter flight.

The movie selection, while not on a par with Cathay or Emirates, was quite good.

The cabin crew weren't particularly friendly, it was hard to get them to smile.

It was very disappointing for them to give out wet wipes to each passenger during the flight, not good for the environment and a waste of time, really who wants them?

Nairobi airport has a large number of shops to look in and plenty of seats.

I would definitely fly them again, depending on price.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0a/37/a1/a2/redarrow2013.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JH-Travels2016,J H wrote a review May 2018,J H,"Brighton and Hove, United Kingdom",1054 contributions,145 helpful votes,Nairobi - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r583300641-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Fine,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I had travelled via Kenya airways on 22nd May to Nairobi via Mombasa and then to India.
We were all aware that it’s been raining in Kenya since more than a month.
Unfortunately it was pouring heavily in Nairobi when we landed. It was disheartening to see that the luggage carrier in which they put our baggages were not covered with plastics or any other way. It was raining quite heavily. I informed the cabin crew they said they will take it further. But nothing happened. I even told the pilot cos I saw that the cabin crew didn’t take any action. The pilot replied “probably nobody was aware about the rains” I was shocked on hearing this cos if the rains have been there since more than a month these amenities should always be ready.
Te pilot and the cabin crew asked me to complain further to any other airport crew or ground staff for the same if I like to.

This wasn’t just it. After landing they made us stay in the flight for more than half an hour. After 15 mins they informed that there is a bus coming to pick us up or we shall get connected to the air bridge and and it was later that they opened the flight gates for the passengers to vacate to notice that there was no aerobridge nor a bus outside.
ALL THE PASSENGERS HAD TO WALK FROM THE FLIGHT TO THE GATE IN THE RAINS AND GET DRENCHED because they couldn’t arrange for either of he two.
It was extremely upsetting to see that.
I was hurt to see my luggage getting wet in the heavy rains in front of myself and I couldn’t even do anything to save it.

On reaching india I saw that my luggage was fully wet.

It’s sad to see that the Kenya airport and the Kenya airways had no amenities ready for rains which were forecasted since long before. And even the ground staff and the crew members didn’t help enough.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/12/3f/82/b4/aashna6.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aashna_610,Aashna P wrote a review May 2018,Aashna P,,83 contributions,8 helpful votes,Mombasa - Nairobi,Domestic,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r582768074-Kenya_Airways-World.html,My luggage got wet due to no plastic covering by baggage crew,Date of travel: May 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"My favourite airline is KLM, so when I heard they are in partnership with Kenya Airways I had high expectations which I doubted they would meet. I was in for a pleasant surprise. First the hosts and hostesses. Smartly attired giving a high calibre service. They smiled, genuinely, and were polite. Once when they came to serve us a meal and my co-passenger was asleep, they signalled to me not to wake him up because they would come back to serve him when he woke up. I made a few requests on the flight and they obliged without a grunt each time. I've not experienced that level of hospitality on any flight before (not even on KLM where the hosts and hostesses work like clockwork).

The plane was very clean; as clean as the KLM hopper from Heathrow to Schipol. I guess the adherence to high standards by KLM has rubbed off on Kenya Airways. There was one stop on the journey to Harare. We stopped at Nairobi for a spell and in the air again after two hours. I must praise the pilot, whose name sounded Nigerian. He flew the plane gracefully and the touch downs were near perfect each time. I've flown Kenya Airways twice and I definitely will continue as it is cheaper than KLM.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/08/05/30/61/fbalintore.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franciss147,Francis S wrote a review May 2018,Francis S,"Peterborough, United Kingdom",18 contributions,7 helpful votes,Amsterdam - Harare,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r582018813-Kenya_Airways-World.html,"Excellent service, smooth flight",Date of travel: June 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I flew from Johannesburg to Nairobi on the 1210 hrs departing flight and then connected after a 3 1/2 hour layover onto the 2055 hrs departing flight from Nairobi to Mumbai. Both legs of the journey they have the new Dreamliner aircrafts. The seats are great and so are the TV screens with plenty to watch on the Entertaiment program that they have. There was only one problem though. On the Johannesburg Nairobi flight they did not have any headsets for people to use in the economy section (not sure if they had the headsets for the business section) for the entire plane. I’ve heard of flights having a few faulty headsets or even a few short but have never heard that they forgot to load the headsets for the entire plane. Service on this flight was not the best but no major hiccups.

On the flight from Nairobi to Mumbai, however, the service was really very bad. I was on an aisle seat and next to me was a lady who was not well travelled. After the dinner service and some time in the night she remembered that she needed to take some medicine and needed water and asked me how could she get some. I promptly pressed the call button to get one of the attendants to get her some water. A few seconds later the call light went off but no one had come. This went on for the next 20-25 minutes and every time we pressed the call button the light would go off in a few seconds but no one would come. Finally one of the attendants from the front in her way to the back asked what was needed. When I told her that we had been calling someone for so long she just casually shrugged and then went away. She did manage to bring the water a couple of minutes later.
Sadly once the meal service is over then no one is bothered about any further service. No point having great new planes if the service is not improved.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YJasani,YJasani wrote a review May 2018,YJasani,"Mumbai, India",27 contributions,6 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Mumbai,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r580015155-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Great new planes but mediocre service ,Date of travel: May 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The day before our flight we were called to tell us our flight would have a 15 hour delay due to technical fault. This meant us having an overnight stay at Heathrow. We booked premier inn and set off on our train.

The food was excellent and the service was faultless. The crew were all friendly, smart and very efficient.

"I must have done the CPT to NBO routing at least 50 times or more with Kenya Airways, but this was the first time ever that I took the direct flight (so no stopover/connecting flight in Jo'Burg but direct Cape Town to Nairobi with a fuel stop in Victoria Falls on the way out and Livingstone on the way back)
On both outbound and inbound flights the KQ pilots went out of their way to give everybody in the plane a good view on the beautiful Victoria Falls....people in the aisle seats were swapping their phones to the people in the window seats so they could take pictures...and first the people on the left side of the plane had the best view and later the people on the right side.
It was so funny, as everybody was so excited and it really felt like a school excursion!

We flew on the relatively small Embraer 190 plane, the nice thing is that it's a 2-2 seat configuration in economy so no big rows. The food was excellent and I was impressed that we had 3 meal choices on this plane, in economy.
Staff very friendly as usual, entertainment system relatively limited on this smaller plane, but still ok and the flight isn't that long (6 hours or so, much faster than doing CPT - JNB 2 hours + connecting time minimum 1.5 hour + JNB - NBO 5 hours)
I would definitely recommend this flight, and airline.

"Four staff checking in eight flights inevitably meant a challenging queue with very little information coming the way of any anxious traveller. Many took to leaping through the barriers. However, once through immigration, the new side of the airport is a huge improvement on the other side (most other airlines). Coffee shops and duty free sparkle at you and the best thing of all... toilets in the departure lounge. KQ itself is in my opinion now better than British Airways. The plane is a Dream Liner and lovely and new. British Airways tends to schedule its oldest, most knackered aeroplanes or this route. I'm sure they rattle. On KQ the entertainment is excellent and they give you two proper meals unlike BA. You don't have to pay extra to book a seat before the flight and the onboard toilets are cleaned regularly. Also you can take far more luggage. Much better option if flying to Nairobi and can cope with a bit of queue barging on the way back. Hint... on the way into Nairobi sit near the front of the plane and fill in your visa form beforehand... available online. This gets you though immigration much faster. Leave plenty of time to get to the airport in Nairobi as the traffic can be hell, especially if it's raining.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e2/e6/default-avatar-2020-45.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/565johnnya,Johnny A wrote a review Apr 2018,Johnny A,"Haywards Heath, United Kingdom",29 contributions,12 helpful votes,Nairobi - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r576560366-Kenya_Airways-World.html,"Long queue, good flight",Date of travel: March 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Kenya Airways carries rightfully the slogan “The Pride of Africa”! Whenever I fly I always look at KQ first and book with them if possible. Whether business class for long haul or economy class for shorter flights the service is always implacable. I have never experienced anything which would have upset me.

Firstly, it has the oldest plane on the route, there is no entertainment on such a long flight. No screens to watch any movies or shows or anything else.

We flew from Amsterdam to Nairobi. Boarding was smooth as was the flight. Well equipped entertainment system and food was fair.

"Food service was pretty poor- about half of the customers were of Indian descent yet the by half way through the plane the only food option available was beef- Hindu's don't eat beef! With 30 people to be served there were no options! Beef was dry and chewy- eewww.

Toilets were filthy- one was out of service and others were very dirty- had to ask staff to clean them several times during the 9hr flight.

Staff bought drinks around and were OK- except at meal time- then they didn't care! Flight was comfortable enough and entertainment system was limited but fine.

"We chose Kenya Airways because we also had an onward internal flight and it made sense to book with the same airline. We sat on the plane an hour or so before take off. Once airborne, the air conditioning was either not working properly or deliberately maintained at a temperature which was too warm and uncomfortable. This was an overnight flight and I awoke feeeling hot and promptly fainted. My husband went to the galley for assistance and was told they were ‘too busy’. The air crew had been disinterested from the start. Eventually, we had assistance but by that time I had dealt with the problem myself. Unimpressed.

"The biggest issue is that Kenya Airways lost my baggage and never compensated me. It arrived late and they told me they would deliver it but they never did. Three weeks after I left the country they emailed me to say they had released it to my ""authorized representative"" and that they considered the matter closed. I did not have an authorized representative, so they just gave it to someone after I left the country and decided they were good to go. I told them this and they never responded. I contacted the appropriate government authorities and they never responded to them either. I tried to sue them but they refused to receive service. Don't fly with this people unless you have no other choice.

Otherwise the flight was okay. There was a drunk loud guy who I had to (was up to) repeatedly quiet, and after the third time or so he shut up. The Kenya Airways crew was too timid to act (even after I told them to they told him in a milquetoast was that he couldn't have more to drink, but then kept their distance), which really isn't acceptable.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/njuloti,njuloti wrote a review Apr 2018,njuloti,"Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan",33 contributions,40 helpful votes,London - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r571358806-Kenya_Airways-World.html,They lost my baggage and never compensated me,Date of travel: June 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Been using this 5 airports in a day route for a year ie 38 flights in mostly the 737-800. It is a 18 hour experience which is a hellish ride and a damn expensive one to boot. Ok, so the company is paying and I accepted eco class travel to be fair. However, for the traveling public it's a mission. Leaving Jhb at 1 am is tedious and gets you into Nairobi without sleep as dinner is served and then find yourself zombied in Nairobi Jomo airport. The non useage of a air bridge with a tight turn around to the next flight makes for frustration and little time to even grab a coffee which is damn expensive at four dollars for Africa. Wifi is good at one hour free so remember to use two devices if longer than one hour there.
With such a long time in a 737 the 7 hours to Accra is awful as the seats are rock hard and food very poor. This is long haul when the offering is domestic level for a full charging full service run. Entertainment is ok, if you get a newer plane but still well below top priced experiences.
You then sit onboard in the plane for 1.5 hours in Accra in boiling conditions with no air on. No drinks, no nothing and toilet use is limited as the plane has to be cleaned and this is priority for KA.
Then a short trip to Monrovia and more mediocre food and another 1.25 hours in the plane on the ground , no aircon no nothing and another clean over dance on board.
So, now having been in a 737 for 17 hours it's 1 hour to Freetown and two packets of peanuts and a beer.hmmmm

Same on the return leg with sleeping almost impossible from Accra to Nairobi as most seat buddies sit starring wide eyed at screens with all manner of sneezing and aromas in full effect.
Add four dumplings of health chemicals by the crew and to put it mildly one is truly concerned about overdosage once rolled off the airfield.

Plus side, had the please of doing one trip business class and to put it mildly it's worth the ride if KQ offer it to you as a free upgrade but I would fork out that cash if I were paying.

The frequent flying set up is a joke. Company spent a fortune on 38 flights and I still didn't even qualify for a few lounge useages.

"I travelled from Frankfurt via Amsterdam to Naiorobi and at least to my destination Zanzibar. I arrived well but my luggage was lost (December 2017) ... it is lost since 3,5 month now. The refund of the KQ insurance is miserable in relative to the missing three weeks holiday as well as the material value of my lost things. I met many people who missed their luggage at Zanzibar when they arrived. I'd never recommend travelling with Kenya Airways again. Better paying a bit more to reach directly because too much people have lost their luggage (10 up to 15 a flight). If you're travelling just with a handluggage this would be fine for you. Any other option would be a compromise.
I am so sorry for the staff ... Hakuna Matata .... I am not going to blame them, they act always very kindly but the system of this airline doesn't act very kindly to the customers if the luggage is lost. Nobody cares about it. This is the sadly truth.
If they'd tought me another way I'll tell you the truth again.
I really hope I am going to be satisfied by the next offer of the insurance. I am wishing all the travellers good luck with their luggage (the best you can do is going just with a handluggage)

"Recently I took a flight from nairobi to mombasa. Flight was at 10.00 AM.  Reached the airport and checked in. Was a short flight, around 45 minutes. Check in was very smooth. Moved to gate and boarded. Plane was small, a 2+2 configuration in economy and a 1+2 configuration in business.  Service was good and juice and a snack pack were served. Descent started.

"I travelled from DXB to Nairobi, with approximately an hour stop over with Kenya Air.
The first part of the trip was FANTASTIC, I was sat there singing their praises and how the staff were so welcoming and everything was above and beyond what I expected, as a regular flyer this compared with the highly recognized flight companies.

Once leaving Nairobi and arriving in Johannesburg I rented a car and drove to stay with my friend and her family. Once going through my suitcase I realized my canon camera bag was missing. Inside the bag was the camera, 2 lenses and a GoPro hero 5 plus the memory cards & necessary wires.

I have tried to contact the company to see if there is anything on their behalf they can do (just Incase this may have been found) but am currently still awaiting a response.

I am absolutely devastated someone has gone through my suitcase and stolen my belongings whilst traveling with this company, again as I said as a regular traveler this has never happened previously.

Downside is a very rushed transfer at Nairobi with little help from the Airline as to where to go for transit.

"As soon as I got onto the flight, I tore open my headset and searched for my favorite movie, noticed everyone else doing pretty much the same and well By dinner time, it still wasn't working and noticed passengers in front of me had the same issue.

There were just 2 cabin crew members in Economy and the flight was full. I feel really bad for the people who were sitting at the back as they had dinner after 2 hours including a glass of water. I'm not blaming the crew, this is a management issue. How do you have 2 members of the crew serving an entire flight

On to the food, The portions are not enough to feed a child. A guy at the back was joking that this is cat food. He was spot on! The bun roll was stale as it was rock hard. The dessert too was soo dry.

For a national airline of Kenya, this is a shame that service is compromised.

Left end of December to mobilize to Freetown for work purposes. Was booked on Kenya Airways as it is a direct flight but with 3 stops and 1 over night stay in Nairobi. Flight was as comfortable as economy class can be. Food was ok and drinks service was good! Crew is very helpful and friendly. Flight was pleasant but in total 28 hours in the air which is very long. Watched lots of movies!!!

"Recently I had to get from Goa, India to Durban, South Africa for a few weeks, returning to Goa thereafter. The Kenya Airways routeing appeared to be the most convenient timewise, though it wasn't the cheapest option. Flying via Mumbai to Nairobi and on to Johannesburg initially they had to hold our connecting flight in Nairobi for us because we arrived late into Nairobi. Onboard, the food quality was poor and seating not that comfortable, with quite shoddy service, but there was a good choice of movies outbound.  Returning to Goa from South Africa was an absolute nightmare because most of us missed our onward connections in Nairobi due to various problems causing our aircraft to arrive over an hour and a half late into Nairobi. To be fair they put us all up in hotels in the city but some people had a 24 hour delay whereas we had a 16 hour delay to catch the next available flight. Because my connection from Mumbai to Goa was on a separate ticket they wouldn't honour this at all, so I also ended up out of pocket having to buy another ticket for the following day, with no compensation offered. It was all a real shambles and their flight schedules which only allow for minimal connection time in Nairobi means that this is something that could happen often. I wouldn't travel this route again with Kenya Airways unless I was specifically heading to somewhere in Kenya itself. It's just too much hassle.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/7c/default-avatar-2020-29.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wjw2018,wjw2018 wrote a review Mar 2018,wjw2018,"Umhlanga Rocks, South Africa",645 contributions,135 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Nairobi,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r564987338-Kenya_Airways-World.html,"Flight delays, short connection times, poor food",,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"It was a tiring, 4 leg journey. For 2 of the legs (Dakar and Abidjan) there was no air conditioning on the ground in the aircraft. The temperatures, being West Africa after all, were unbearable. Although the B737 flown for the first 2 legs was reasonably well equipped, I am not a fan of flying long legs in a narrow body aircraft designed for regional travel. The last 2 legs were flown in an E190. In my opinion, a totally unsuitable aircraft for passengers for such a long trip. Mandatory refuelling stops en route are a testament to the fact that this aircraft shouldn't be doing such long flights.

"To sum up what we have been through:
1. When we were in transit in Kenya, the ground crew declined us from boarding and said we need to present return ticket otherwise we can’t get in...with extremely terrible, careless cold attitude. We never been told we need the return ticket to get in the flight/entering the country before. We flew through the same airline and no one told us about this, we almost missed our flight.
地勤在”轉機”時擋人，突然要求出示回程機票，態度極度冷淡，差一點上不了飛機。
2. When I claimed my luggage on arrival - my backpack’s cover was gone and one item was lost & missing.
杯包套不見，我放在夾層的小背包也不翼而飛。
Details:
Me and my boyfriend are frequent flyer and we already travel in africa for 3.5 months for 8 countries and we never had problem with flight transition in every airport/ country here.

Yesterday we flew from Zanzibar Tanzania to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia through Kenya airline. We checked in Zanzibar and we had all of our boarding pass/ luggage direct to Addis Ababa straightaway which is great. We only need to transit and wait in Kenya airport for 2 hours then we go- everything was perfectly ok.

Until we tried to boarding at gate in Kenya, the ground crew who called Mary she said we have to present the return ticket from Addis Ababa otherwise we can’t get in the plane. We were so shocked cos no one told us about this issue and we never been requested before.
So we asked: “but why the crew who checked in us to here didn’t mention anything ?”Then she replied coldly: “they only checked from Tanzania to Kenya, they are not responsible for this transit.”We were like how can this sounds like you guys work for different company and we are the two idiots.

She insisted we need to buy the return ticket otherwise there’s no way we can get in. Look at the time - We only had less then 10 minutes before gate closing but she only replied: you still have 5 minutes you can buy ticket now ...with careless attitude and totally ignored we were constantly telling her- we can get the visa on arrival for sure and we checked online before, there’s no need to present return ticket for visa (which this has been proved is true that we spent less than 10 min to have the visa on arrival in Addis Ababa by the time we got there).
She just walked away and we don’t understand why she declined us when we were in transit and she even is not the immigration office, also please remember if return ticket is a must thing to have then you should have told us when we were in Zanzibar not in Kenya! She even said we will move your luggage cos you can’t get in...

We were so panic but had no choice to buy the ticket on the spot... you can imagine how slow was the airport WiFi...and all the pressure.
Then we finally allowed to get into the plane at the very last minute.

This is not the end of the story, i was then found my backpack cover missing (my only luggage is a 50L backpack with the cover) then I noticed one of my small backpack which was put in the layer was missing...it was very obvious showing this must be taken from somebody intentionally. (cos I put the bag under the layer tightly, there’s no way it could fall from my backpack)We are super disappointed about this big airline. We will never take this flight and tell people better not to fly with them either.

"This is a review of various flights taken over a two week period. Nairobi to Kisumu to Mombasa to Malindi and back (you get the idea). The domestic section of KQ (as Kenyan Airways is affectionately called locally) is a better product than the International but both seemed to meet my standards. There were auto upgrades since I am a Diamond Member on Delta which they code share. Seamless transition from New York/Amsterdam to Nairobi, then Mombasa. We cleared Immigration in Nairobi, then popped our bags right back on the belt to Mombasa. Check in with Sky Priority. Not sure how this will be handled now that KQ will be having non-stops to New York with competition by KLM and Delta.
Good service..they even manage to serve you juice, tea etc AND a snack on the 45 minute hop from Nairobi to Mombasa or Kisumu or Malindu.

"The flight is a basic flight like any other. The seats were comfortable enough, although the pillow offered were tiny and thin. The food was standard fair and all perfectly edible.

My only problems were with the entertainment. There is so little selection in the way of new movies that we'd already seen everything they had to offer. It was all older (""classic"") movies bar a small number of newer titles. After a month of being in Zimbabwe and flying back even in a different calendar year, I was looking forward to having at least a different selection on the way home, but it wasnt to be. The exact same movies were available... We didnt want to watch them in December, so in January we were till not interested.

When checking in at Harare, we asked for window and next to it. We were told that this would be fine. When we got on the plane, we found that we'd been given central seats nowhere near where we'd asked to be seated.

"The trip was the first leg back from Kenya. Nairobi to Amsterdam. Very good service and attentiveness. Flight Attendants (FA) were welcoming and smiling. Of note: Most passengers, except Business Class were either tourists or business people of original European origin. The food was good. Since it was a morning departure, they served us, oddly, either eggs OR sausage. Wine, Kenyan Beer (the best I think), Hard liquor was served, oddly even for breakfast.
The dinner was a great Fish or Beef Curry - Kenyan-Indian Fusion food. It was good. FAs were efficient and courteous.
When we landed, we were met by armed Koninklijke Marechaussee, The Dutch State Police. That was unnerving to some passengers. They were checking validity of Kenyan passports it seems with special devices. I remember this a few times happening on a KQ but not KLM flights from Nairobi.

"I have reviewed this airline previously for a different flight & I feel I should warn other travelers of what to expect. Their fares are cheap & that makes them the first option for many travelers. The on-board service is quite good & the airport in Nairobi isn't awful. If you travel without check in luggage & aren't pushed for time, then they probably are okay. However, this airline is notorious for losing luggage (Sometimes the whole flight's luggage), the flights get delayed & it doesn't get communicated with you as the passenger. Entertainment systems frequently don't work or are faulty. Trying to get hold of customer care is a mission & when you do, they are quite cold & rude.

"I really had a great time on this flight and on the last leg, when I had an issue leaving Entebbe (nothing to do with the airline or the airport), Kenya Airways customer service at the airport was very nice while she helped me book another flight.

I flew from Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania to Nairobi, Kenya to Bujumbura, Burundi unexpectedly to Kigali, Rwanda and lastly, to Entebbe, Uganda. I asked to meet the pilots at the end of the first leg, from Dar to Nairobi, and my request was happily granted by one of the crew. The pilots themselves were also super nice and allowed me to take a picture with them (taken by the same, aforementioned crew member).

I had substantial layovers in all locations, especially in Kigali, all of which I chose purposely. The exception was Burundi. We were there for such a short time (to pickup passengers), we were not allowed off of the plane. Otherwise, I enjoyed my layovers and the good customer service from Kenya Airways employees along the way.

On the way back to Dar, I went from Entebbe to Nairobi to Dar. This flights were also smooth and customer service must have been fine again, as I do not recall any issues.

"I Will never fly with Kenya Airways again!

Or a heads up for anyone who is daft enough to fly Kenya Airways.

They call themselves the Pride of Africa! I would like to challenge that and say they are the hustlers of Africa

They have left me stranded in Kenya and put a suspension on the last leg of my flight due to me missing one leg of my domestic internal flights. Even though I have fairly paid for all my seat on all the connecting flights.

Speaking of the unhelpful customer services. I spent 30 mins on the phone, only to be placed on hold and eventually cut off with the issue unresolved. I then decided to go to the main office in Nairobi in hopes that something could be appeased only to find out that my only option is to book a new flight.

My primary advice would be, never to fly with Kenya Airways, they have such nonsensical and unfair policies.

"To give Kenya Airways its due, the service was very efficient and pleasant at Heathrow Airport. There was also a superficial pleasantness on the plane. But throughout the journey the flight staff was conspicuous by its absence. They simply ignored us until it was time to serve us food and drink, and then it was perfunctory to say the least. I asked for a gin and tonic. No tonic available, nor lemonade, nor anything that would go with a gin. The flight was on time but I have to say that I dreaded the trip back. The only way to describe the food on this return flight (from Nairobi to Heathrow) was that it was disgusting. I could not eat it. None of it.

"""We promise your experience will be worth the while."" - Kenya Airways Facebook post 3 - Feb - 2018

The problem with this post is that it is geared to set expectation where you are not prepared to deliver. You have a lovely fleet but your punctuality is appalling. So whilst your pockets are filled and I am certain you are making a healthy profit, your business practices are a lopsided mishandling of #our time. So when you say you ""promise"" to make my experience ""worth the while,"" you are literally taking me, the customer for granted. You have no contingency reaction which shows that you do value customers. Trend in KQ shows that you have been allowed to get away with inconvenience and thus have become complacent: After all you are a national Flight so what or whom truly is threatening your position which exploits the customer?

"In the last two years, I travel with Kenya Airways between 8-10 times a year. Each time I want to make an amendment to my existing ticket end up with so much problems that can take up to 3 days to resolve. They have in a number of occasions cancelled my ticket without notifying me, I end up paying more money. The staff at their offices are super rude, unhelpful and defensive. Kenya Airways are quick to take the money not give the service you pay for......SERVICE! Too much delays too!

The service I get on-board is very good except the movies have not been updated for God knows how long. I tend to see the same movies each time. I mentioned this to the stewardess and she referred me to this site, nicely though. Beatrice and Lilian at the business class from London to Nairobi on 06th December 2017, KQ 101 were brilliant, they referred me by my name throughout the flight.

DISAPPOINTED with Kenya Airways offices in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. As an international airline, a good service is a minimum requirement both on-board and on the ground. I pray that I DO NOT travel Kenya Airways again in the near future.

"Love flying between SA and Kenya on Kenya Airways and have done so on numerous occasions and really like their upgrade system from Economy to Business Class, very innovative, have made use of the Upgrade on numerous occasions. BUT. On my last trip I tried to do the ""NORMAL"" upgrade but there was a technical problem which I could not resolve. Decided to visit the airport early to try and resolve. The ticket counter did not open at the advertised time, 20 minutes late. Waited in the Q for over 40 minutes still no service. Went to the check-in counter, a sign is displayed ""ask me about Business Class"", you can't do anything at check-in you must go back to the Ticket Office. I already had a bad experience at the Ticket Counter so I was not going to go back to experience bad service with additional time delays. If you are going to offer a service, a number of things need to happen, 1. Times advertised must be adhered to, don't open 20 minutes late 2. Don't offer ""Upgrades"" at the check-in counter only to advise me to go back to the Ticket Office. 3. if there is a technical problem on the on-line Upgrade system please advise your customers accordingly.
I would travel Kenya Airways again as the many positive experiences out way the one negative but it does leave a negative perception. Service, Food, legroom and seats are great once on the plane.

"We have flown Kenya Airlines twice in a period of 6 months - the last time in January 2018 being rerouted by SWISS air. Although we had our doubts the pilots where extremely proficient and the cabin crew friendly and professional.

The first flight took us from Amsterdam to Nairobi to Victoria Falls to Cape Town and the second time instead of Victoria Falls to Livingston. On both flights the pilots took us for amazing scenic flight over the Victoria Falls.

The only complaint one might have is the lack of water on the Nairobi to Cape Town leg. Where other airlines will give water constantly, we only got water offered with lunch.

I am very concern about the on time performance as I have to drive to Masai Mara on the first day of arrival. The crews are average, not really polite and the worst thing is they slept like log at the chair during 8 hours flight. After supper, they went to sleep and passengers have to walk to the pantry to look for drinking water. Most airlines have crews to offer water or juice to the passengers along the flight. Another bad experience was I asked for hot water to make my own coffee. The crew didn't help you to do so, she just pointed the hot water tap and let you get your water by yourself and she sit at the chair without doing anything. The toilet is a joke, never being clean during 8 hours flight and you can imagine how wet is the floor. The food is a joke.

"I have to say, I didn't know what to expect - when you book cheaper flights like I did, they are always a few connecting flights with layovers, and one expects the quality to be perhaps lower than the direct flight carriers that charge a lot more. Well I was quite wrong!
Upon boarding the plane (Jhb -> Kenya) one of the Kenya Air staff was greeting everyone with a big hug, or ""bro hug"", or handshake for those passengers that didn't seem too keen for a hug :) while saying some kind words like ""wishing you just the best for 2018"". This was my first time ever seeing something like this and I was really touched by this kind gesture - true African hospitality.

"Flew from Dubai to Nairobi and supposed to fly to Johannesburg.  Got an SMS to say our Kenya connection had been cancelled but we were being put on to an SAA flight only a little later so thought no problem.  Arrived in Kenya to be told that the original flight had actually been downgraded so they couldn't accomodate us on business class ( no offer to downgrade)  then the SAA flight is already full ( crap ! as my hubby went to check them boarding and definately not full- especially business class when they called it) so Kenya Airways in their infinite wisdom moved us to a later Kenya Air flight - 7 hours later.   We missed our connection to the Kruger Park and had to book into a hotel in Jhb for the night. I firmly believe they didn't want to pay SAA for our business class flights to they didn't try to get us onto the flight.  Told us to wait in the lounge for a manager, waited over 90 minutes and only got hold of someone after asking reception to contact them 3 times and tweeting Kenya Airways Customer Service.   Was told all we can get is $200 inconvenience refund but we had to contact customer services ourselves, no one in the airport ( THEIR HOME AIRPORT MIND YOU) could help.  I logged a request, and followed up with the ticket info when we got back to Dubai, 2 days ago and nothing.  Not sure why they can't refund our credit card but hey. The customer service desk in Nairobi was full of clients screaming and shouting who had flights cancelled last minute.  Happened to my daughter last year returning from Jhb to Dubai too but thought it was a once off.  NEVER EVER AGAIN !  Be warned, they are going through tough times and the service is slipping.

Comfort 0
Food horrible (ate nothing except for the nuts and drinks)
Cabin crew: rude and uninterested....didnot bother to take care of the passengers....absolutely no interest and experience
A specific remark: I asked for tomato juice, which when I tasted was tasting weird, hence I didnot drink it. The female serving us gave me extremely bad looks for not having finished that....
An absolute nightmare was a crying and howling female sitting at the back of the plane..she was basically deported from

"It was just the business without any class from Kenya Airways! The seat pockets were found unclean when I boarded. Equally bad were the blanket and pillows. Obviously, the flight cabin was not serviced properly prior to departure. There was no welcome drink that is a practice in the Business class in all airline services. Breakfast was below par.Flight attendants appeared to be too lazy! The inflight entertainment system is outdated and collection of content is limited.

A senior executive at the boarding gate misplaced my boarding card causing much anxiety. Another junior executive worked hard for 20 minutes to locate the boarding pass that was mistakenly handed over to another passenger!

Traumatizing experience.  Flew in from the USA to Tanzania for a conference.  my luggage did not arrive for two nights and i was neither given any compensation for the inconvenience nor kept informed as to progress with locating the suitcase.  The flight laid over in Zanzibar then onto Kilimanjaro but we remained on the aircraft.  This was not a pleasant flight and I would not willingly take it ever again. Kenya Airways is a disgrace by virtue of this service and the way they handled the missing luggage of over 15 passengers on that flight.  the baggage service desk at Kilimanjaro airport was very lackadaisical in handling the complaints but perhaps they did their best with the facility at their disposal.  Still their attitude left much to be desired given the circumstance; people are upset because their luggage did not arrive yet no definitive information was forthcoming.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/11/af/04/a8/melvin-d-a.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melvinda2017,melvin d ayogu wrote a review Jan 2018,melvin d ayogu,"Decatur, Georgia",57 contributions,12 helpful votes,Nairobi - Kilimanjaro National Park,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r551396894-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Luggage may not arrive and expect no support from the airline,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I booked confirmed seats on Kenya for our Christmas stay in SA, as normally we travel standby at other times of the year.
The motivating factor was price and I must say I was very pleasantly surprised.
The aircraft on outbound and return were Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Leg room was very good and seats comfortable with great headrests.
In flight entertainment was not brilliant as many films were old and I have to say that the catering was probably the worst I’d encountered in 28 years of working in the Industry, however I don’t take a flight for the food and have always been surprised at passengers reactions to it.
I usually eat before I board or take something ‘in case’.
The crew were great. Very polite, helpful and smiley. An improvement on BA!!!
Connections via NBO were a bit longer than I would have liked but really I certainly wouldn’t dissuade anyone from booking them.

"Probably one of the few airlines that could fly into Kenya. We are Singaporeans, so we flew into Bkk and transferred to Kenya Air to enter Nairobi.  Went on Economy and it was bearable.  The flight was stable, the food average, the service was not too bad and toilets were quite cleane.  BUT, the biggest bugbear here was the timing.  We were ready to head out to Nairobi from Bkk at midnite S'pore time.  However, the flight was so badly delayed that we only managed to take off only at 4am+!  That affected a lot of things esp those at Nairobi.  The layover time was 3hrs, the delay was another 3.5hrs, all in all, we sat at Bkk airport for nearly 7 hrs!  But still, all was good and we took off. On our journey home, I decided to give my family a treat and upgraded (with payment) to 4 Biz Class seats.  It was much better and this time, surprisingly, no delays!  It took off on the DOT!  Wow, what a treat. Biz class here is as per other biz class.  Not any better nor any worse if you compare against EUR or USA liners.  However, it would lose out to Asian liners I would imagine.  Seats were generally cleaned, reclined to straight and level, bigger screens, champagne to kick-off the flight, blankets were thick n fluffy, headphones were diff from those in Econ class, etc.  We had seat nos 3s and 4s.  So we were in the first sector of the aircraft just behind the cockpit.  As such, we had no disturbances from the Econ class side as behind us, there were another 5 rows of Biz Class.  Very quiet and lots of privacy.  Our family slept like babies and before you knew it, they were announcing to descend!  When we landed, we yearned for more time in the Biz class but...., and we landed with fresh minds and fresh bodies, very little lethargy unlike from Econ class.   If you asked me, I reckoned its all worth the upgrade and I am happy I gave my family a treat like this.  Conclusion - DO IT!

"On my business class trip from bangkok to nairobi, seat 2D did not work, it could not recline, and none of the buttons worked, it had to be manually put flat, and then manually be put back upright, and only the crew can do that.

The service was also terrible, our hostess never had a smile, was inattentive, and would not even acknowledge if she heard my request, or any request.

The food was disgusting, two pieces of rubber chicken for breakfast, along with potatoes that looked dried up, and a slop of spinach. How is that breakfast? No eggs?? Sausage?? Oh they did give a croissant.

I have traveled business class in several airlines, this has to be the absolute worst so far.

Also for duty free shopping onboard, be careful as the standard excuse seems to be they do not have change if you pay with dollars, but yet I saw another hostess providing change to another passenger in dollars, and I had to chase them for change, they left it to the last minute before landing.

This type of service and attitude stems from the top, thoroughly disgusted.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/7c/01/default-avatar-2020-5.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pshah99,pshah99 wrote a review Jan 2018,pshah99,"Johannesburg, South Africa",257 contributions,56 helpful votes,Bangkok - Nairobi,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r550767981-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Thoroughly Disgusted,Date of travel: January 2018,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"In June 2017 I booked a flight to Hanoi for myself and my daughter through TRIPSTA. We were to depart at 12h10 on 1 December 2017, stop over at Nairobi and then straight to Hanoi. In October I booked a flight (again through TRIPSTA) for my son who decided to join us.The only flight I could find for him was JHB-Nairobi-Bankok-Hanoi. I decided to book this particular flight because the three of us would at least have been able to fly together from Johannesburg to Nairobi. When we got to the Check-In Counter of Kenya Airlines I was informed that there was a problem with the tickets for me and my daughter. I was told that all flights from Nairobi to Hanoi have been suspended since 1 October 2017 and that the Booking Agency was supposed to have rescheduled our flights! I was told to contact TRIPSTA to sort out the problem. To my horror the woman I spoke to at TRIPSTA told me that there is nothing that can be done they will refund me!!?? My son had to get onto the 12h10 flight and I had already booked 4 Domestic flights in Vietnam (all paid for in advance) as well as 4 different hotels for our holiday there (Time for free cancellation of the Hotel bookings already expired) I was devastated. It was imperative that we fly to Hanoi on 1 December and not a day later. I explained this to the Check-In Clerk of Kenya Airlines and he referred me to their Booking Counter to see what can be done. They were really kind and understanding and immediately started searching for alternative options. At the end of the day my son left on his scheduled flight and me and my daughter followed at 17h10.

"I travelled economy to Tanzania. The airline was fine, the food was satisfactory and all flights were on time. I found airline staff to be abrupt and a little rude, but the most stressful ordeal was that my luggage was delayed for 3 days and counting. I understand that baggage can be delayed and that mistakes happen, however I was able to get from Australia to Africa in 1 day - I struggle to understand how my bag ended up being so far behind! I was patient and laughed it off, however I found staff to be rude and careless with dealing with the situation. I found customer care to be non-existent. I have not received an apology, nor any updates on where my luggage is in the world. I have had to cancel my trip up Mt kilimanjaro and a safari due to the delay. Very disappointing Kenya Airways. I will not be flying with Kenya Airways again and would advise against it. It’s one thing to lose/delay someone bag, but it’s another thing to leave them in the dark, not answer the phone or reply to emails and provide no assistance whatsoever to rectify the error! Travellers are often on a schedule and customer service needs to be better than that. Kenya Airways could not organise a piss up in a brewery and when things go tits up, they don’t want to know about it.

"The Kenya Airways flight into Nairobi as well as the flight back to Dubai were delayed. There was no explanation why the flight going in was late, but that along with a time consuming visa procedure ate into our half-day plan for Nairobi.

The flight back was postponed by 5 hours, I believe due to visibility issues, Dubai was in the middle of a sandstorm, which is really not anything the airlines could help, but they could have given us a place to rest as this meant we were sitting through the entire night at the airport. No lounge services offered, and the seating at Nairobi airport is not meant for long use.

We missed the onward connecting flight because of the delay, KQ said they had rescheduled us for a later connection, but upon arrival into Dubai we found they hadn't reissued the tickets and we almost missed that flight too in the flurry of reissue procedures and unnecessary fuss. To top it all, they misplaced one of our bags which arrived home 24 hours late. Our safari in Kenya was superb, such a pity the flying experience didn't match. .",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/09/e6/b6/9e/nilanjanabose.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/593nilanjanab,Nilanjana B wrote a review Dec 2017,Nilanjana B,"Denarau Island, Fiji",110 contributions,45 helpful votes,Dubai - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r549525490-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Not a good experience,Date of travel: December 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"On the 16th of December I flew from Singapore to Mumbai with Jet Airways flight 9W9 then flew from Mumbai to Dubai 9W558 with Jet Airways. I then few with Kenya Airways Dubai to Nairobi KQ311 and final flight with Kenya Airways Nairobi to Kilimanjaro KQ6722.

The last time I saw my luggage was in Singapore. I confirmed with Kenya Airways customer desk that the luggage had made it to Dubai Airport I then also confirmed with the Kenya Airways customer desk in Nairobi Airport that my luggage had arrived.

This was also following a flight delay of 3hrs from Dubai with Kenya Air on the 17th of December. Due to this delay I missed my connecting flight to Kilimanjaro at 0800 on the 17th of December and was rescheduled for 1650 on the 17th December.

The main reason of travel was to hike Mount Kilimanjaro (requiring correct equipment). I reported the luggage missing on arrival in Kilimanjaro on the 17th December. My 8 day hike was to begin 18th December. I delayed to the 19th in hope of the luggage arriving. It is now the 26th of December and as a result of the missing luggage I had to hire and buy gear for my trip. Neither airlines have bothered to contact me following the report of missing luggage and providing email address and contact details. The email address on their website for lost baggage also returns undeliverable receipt.

I will not travel again with this airline.....a ruined Christmas.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/d5/default-avatar-2020-17.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissaht81,melissaht81 wrote a review Dec 2017,melissaht81,hobart,1 contribution,16 helpful votes,Dubai - Kilimanjaro National Park,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r549228702-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Do Not Fly with Kenya Airlines,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I flew KQ as it has a direct flight to/from Bangkok. I must say the standard of service has gone down drastically. The only thing I can say that is positive is that the ground crew - check in staff were efficient and polite.
The flight was very uncomfortable, probably because I was squeezed off my seat by a huge man (fat) from DRC. Why he was given a middle seat I will never know except to say that someone thought it would be funny. I asked if he did online checkin to which he said no.
My seat wouldn't recline & the screen worked intermittently which made the journey extremely long!
The food was terrible and not enough for a child leave alone an adult. This was confirmed by the fat man sitting next to me,or rather on part of me,when he asked the steward for a second meal! Which incidentally he was given! To my disgust he was also given 2 bottles of wine to drink with his breakfast!
The other thing was that the toilets were filthy. On a 9 hour flight you would expect the crew to clean the toilets at least 2 or 3 times. But the floor in the two toilets I visited were soaking wet, there was no tissue and the basin was blocked in one.
The cabin was a mess with paper and blankets dropped which gave a feel of uncleanliness and untidiness!
If I can avoid flying KQ in the future I will and will not be recommending it to anyone. Definitely not what it used to be.

It was the same in the lounge at JKIA, rude, slow female staff on the desk. No wonder this airline is in trouble.

The onboard service was truly experienced, the food was good and the beverage choice was plentiful.

What I wondered, was the spray one of the staff members was diffusing the air with inside the plane? To be precise -- the spray was pointed towards the ceiling of the cabin...

"We took our grandchildren to Kenya to see the elephants they adopted last Christmas. We flew on the excellent new Boeing 787 recently introduced on the route by Kenya Airways. KQ has always offered a better seat pitch than their competitors and unlike British Airways don’t consign economy to a nasty, small section at the back of the aircraft.

I’m one of those hated people who can sleep on an aircraft under any conditions so I can’t comment on dinner service, but the day time service was excellent, the plane does make travel easier especially due to its humidifying system and lower cabin pressure.

The deportee screamed and moaned in the hope (as I understood it) that they would be taken off the flight.  They weren't - the female passenger screamed and moaned for the first three hours.  At one point I took a walk to see where they were (right at the back of the plane) and felt so sorry for the passengers in that section who had their headphones rammed against their ears presumably with the volume turned up full blast to try and drown out the screams.

"I was travelling on a KLM issued ticket from London to Nairobi via Amsterdam and took a Kenya Airways flight at Amsterdam. KLM and KQ are flying blue partners but the way I was treated by the check in staff in London was extremely rude. I had a hand luggage and my lap top bag which KLM had allowed in the London-Amsterdam segment and in a much smaller plane than the KQ flight to Nairobi. The lady at the check in station simply told me to leave my bag with her in spite my explanation that the bag had some valuables and I had no place to transfer the same to. This hand luggage was equally the right size bag and was weighing less than 10 kilogrammes, which is why KLM allowed it in as a hand luggage.

While KQ (Kenya Airways) is generally a decent airline, it is this kind of behavior by some of their staff (partners) that negatively impacts their customers' experience.

To make matters worse, one of their inflight attendants had a very bad attitude towards customers. unfortunately I did not take her details.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/8b/avatar012.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ajei2000,Ajei2000 wrote a review Dec 2017,Ajei2000,"Nairobi, Kenya",151 contributions,35 helpful votes,Amsterdam - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r544959827-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Reliable African airline,Date of travel: October 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Though transit time was only 50 minutes at Nairobi, it was very smooth. We could conveniently go through the terminal for change of plane. Further the baggages were transferred most efficiently though the weather was not cooperative. (light continuous drizzle) We received the baggages in tact at Johannesburg.
The food (AVML) was very average. Spice level has to be suitable for all types of passengers. Need some improvement in the menu.
Business class seats are very uncomfortable.(Airbus 737-800) Seat adjustment buttons to recline are very hard to operate and the recline is not sufficient to stretch enough. In effect the seats are not designed properly for adequate relaxation. Need attention to improve.

I've flown Kenya Airways a few times and their small Embraer aircraft have in-flight entertainment systems. This one particular flight had them installed but not turned on and they made no effort to inform passengers as to why this was. I wasn't itching to watch a movie but I definitely was counting on having a functioning usb outlet to charge my phone (I just assume these two seat-back functions are connected). Also because there was no room in the overhead lockers I noticed business class was about 70% empty. I asked the flight attendant if she could place my back forward and she refused and cited no reason at all. I told her that if I had to walk to the back of the plane to store my bag it would be slower for everyone getting off the plane. This didn't matter to her and that makes no sense to me at all.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chris54354,Chris54354 wrote a review Nov 2017,Chris54354,"Vancouver, Canada",137 contributions,23 helpful votes,Nairobi - Harare,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r542686670-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Solid Airline,Date of travel: October 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I had booked my flight from Bangkok to Johannesburg with a stopover in Kenya via Kenyan Airways KQ861. My flight was due to leave at 00:35 to arrive in Kenya at 05:35. I received an email that my flight time has changed to depart at 05:35 instead.

Then received another confusing email to state that departure is back to the original time set. Then received another email stating the departure time will be 05:00. I now very confused so I called the offices where the email was from, a travel agency?

I started to worry and panic. I tried checking in online, that was also a bit confusing as the times had changed but original information was still there. It looked like you had a choice to fly the same flight at either 00:35 or 05:35am. Maybe depending on numbers they would decide when exactly do we fly? Hee hee hee.

Due to the confusion, I left the hotel early to make the 00:35 flight just in case. I was one of many people who were stuck here due to miscommunication. We were ushered into a VIP Lounge for food and refreshments after midnight. How do you eat at that time of the night? We could have been comfortable in our beds. But at least we could all fall asleep in the cosy chairs while we waited for our departure time at 05:35. Four hours later our announcement to board.

During the stopover in Nairobi  I used the lounge to get some decent food. The washrooms were not clean and over populated with waiting guests. The staff told me that they had run out of food and that at 07.00 am. I was left with a coffee and went to the shop to buy some chocolates.

"Kenya Airways managed to loose one of our bags on the flight from Johannesberg to Nairobi on the 23rd of October We were flying out for a safari early the next morning so it was essential to locate the bag which contained my wifes bush wear. The staff could not have been less helpful if they tried. A lost bag report was provided along with a reference number but no understanding of where the bag actually was! Next morning we had to rush to find a store to buy underwear and warm clothing for my wife prior to catching an early flight to the Abadares. Despite calls every day the bag did not turn up. We were assured that the bag was in Johannesberg and we would be reunited with it when we returned to Nairobi for an overnight stay. Back in Nairobi the bag had still not been delivered to our hotel. The hotel concierge then followed up for us and was assured that the bag had come to Nairobi at 3:30 that afternoon and was to be delivered to the hotel. When I was told this I arranged transport and went to the airport to pick the bag up, only to be informed that the bag was ""not here"". Once again I was assured that the bag was in J'berg and they would send it to our next destination which was Mauritius. I had no faith that this would happen and suggested that a better plan would be to keep the bag in J'berg and we would pick it up on our way back to Australia. Everyone agreed and the bag status, I was assured would be updated on the system to reflect that plan. A few days later back in J'berg I followed up the bag only to be told it was in Paris! (I am not making this up) and they were flying it back to Nairobi so I could pick it up there. Eventually they determined it was not our bag in Paris but still could not determine where our bag actually was and suggested I fill out an insurance claim form. So here we are back in Australia on the 2nd of November and the bag is still missing!! My point is, no one actually took ownership of the issue it was all delegated to someone else and I was just told whatever I wanted to hear to get rid of me.

"The outward flight from Harare went smoothly with no delays. Service was good and the food was edible. The return trip was more problematic. There was no attempt to indicate the KQ flight on the usual display boards in Addis apart from being told the gate number as one checked in. Only saw one ground staff before departure for the flight which was delayed. In flight- was sitting near two children, one managed to land with a seat belt unfastened- yet the mother was sitting opposite and also because there was no walk by of the crew checking seat belt compliance before landing. The safety video did not come on yet it was a fairly new plane, so the safety talk was delivered by the air stewards. Hard to see what they were doing when you are in the window seat. Far too many people got on with huge suitcases, some struggling to put them in the overhead lockers, not sure KQ still weighs hand luggage before departure. Further delay experienced in Nairobi- at least in the upgraded airport, it was not such an unpleasant experience.

"That's what Kenya Airways calling itself. It's a hidden champion if you have a destination the airline is operating. A very new fleet all in all they runs the 787 Dreamliner! Service on board is good,  meals are existing  (I had better ones) the seats are comfortable with flat bed function. The point is the price!

"Kenya Airways is one of Africa's best Airlines. The booking is easy and the on-board service is great. I have flown Kenya Airways and its Sky Team partners for several years now and have had no problems at all. The planes are modern (The last three times I used this airline,  I flew in a Dream Liner which is one of the latest range of luxury aeroplanes.

"Very disappointed about Kenya Airways and Sky Team. The flight to Nairobi was almost an hour delayed and we got only informed 5min before the original boarding time - no communication at all. We made it on time to the connection flight, they were still boarding but the staff refused us - saying we were too late (they were still boarding while they were saying that!). There was no reason at all for not letting us on the plane! They just stopped talking to us and ignored us completely without giving an explanation. We had to wait 4h for the next flight, the manager came and told us it was because we were late (which is a lie) and also because there was not enough food on the plane (seriously?! It's a 50min flight and I can happily be without the low-quality sandwich offered).

"From the quadruple checking of luggage a joke (as my son had a bottle of orange tango in his backpack from Mombasa!) to the rude stewardesses on the flight.

We had been up for a number of hours as we flew from Mombasa to Nairobi then on to Heathrow, so were extremely tired. I asked politely if we could have 3 blankets and was rewarded with silence and a glare as she tossed over 3 blankets and walked off!

The sound on my TV didn't work neither did the USB, which was fine as i tried to sleep. The cabin crew (same woman) was not interested when i told her, so some poor other traveller will have nothing to watch for the 8 hour trip (row 21).

I have always been a huge supporter of the airline and I do really enjoy the service from KQ but it would seem the attention detail in servicing the aircraft does seem to be declining.

"In Brief:

Good -
Onboard Service - Ok

Bad-
Delays - 40mins in ABJ and 5 hours in Nairobi for 2nd Sector
Comfort - Old aircraft with hard seats
Entertainment - None
Food - Pathetic
Gate Service - Pathetic
Hygiene - Old and dirty aircraft

For a 6.5 hour flight, a 30year old aircraft more suited to short haul flights was used. The seats were so old the foam in the cushions were compressed. Very hard seats. Once we arrived in Nairobi I had a transfer to a Mumbai flight. We waited for a 5-hour delay for this flight and we received a token for breakfast. This was a piece of white bread, a sausage, a fried egg and tea or coffee. Given that most people on the flight were vegetarian this was not a good solution for a plane full of angry guests. No water was provided at any time not even at the cafe where they gave the food.

The staff at the gate were unable to provide proper information and the flight just got later and later. The information board was also giving wrong times.

"I was disconcerted when, arrving at Ivato Airport well in time for my flight to Nairobi scheduled for 15.30 to find that it was delayed until 21.20. Six hours was a long time to kill. When we did depart (at the new scheduled time), it was explained that the delay was cause by the diversion of the aircraft resulting from extreme monsoon rains in Mumbai. These things happen! It did means tha we missed the connecting flight to Paris CDG, but after going thorough the formalities, which took a while, we were booked into the Meridian Hotel in Nairobi, which was fine and they looked after us for 24 hours until the following day's flight to Paris, which then went according to plan.

"We were in the lounge when an announcement was made the flight was delayed. The next thing we knew we were called to ""final boarding"". Arrived at the gate to confusion. Once we were boarded the confusion continued. Lots of chatting among staff at the doors for about 20 minutes. During that time there was no attempt to serve the business class passengers. It was a long flight. No water bottles provided which is fine because we like to try and keep things environmentally friendly but also had to ask repeatedly for glasses of water. Had to help ourselves to pillows and blankets from a bin. They ran out of 2 of the 3 choices of breakfast by row 4 in business class. The USB charger in my seat didn't work. My headphones made a loud screeching noise if I turned my head. My seat wouldn't fully recline. During take off and landing our attendant kicked off her shoes and slept.

"The flight itself was good, the food was pretty average and the service was okay. When we arrived in Zanzibar, two of our four bags were missing. It was such a mission to get our baggage but after much trouble and going back and forth to the airport our bags arrived about 1 and a half days later. I guess this missing baggage was due to the fact that we had traveled on Kenya Airways via a connecting flight to Nairobi and Dar es Salaam so our bags probably got taken off at the wrong airport.

The airline didn't get back to any of the e mails I sent and it is very difficult to get hold of them when you are in a different country and only have Wifi. The airport staff at Zanzibar Int however, were quite helpful and managed to communicate with the relevant people that our bags were missing.

"On the Heathrow to Nairobi route there are only two options British Airways or Kenya Airways, we'd never flown with Kenya Airways before and they offered an excellent package which we decided to try.

From start to finish for both the outbound and inbound flights from the moment we entered the airports and proceeded to check-in everything was very smooth, efficient and also very friendly whilst still being professional.

Easy boarding onto the Dreamliner gave favourable impressions with other operators of the type we have used and the business cabin at the front of the aircraft have seats which go fully flat as well.

The cabin crew were very presentable (in charming red uniforms) and efficient and offered drinks, meals and other items in a pro-active way which was very relaxing and made the 8-9 hour trip enjoyable and every detail of the service was well thought out.

The food was particularly good and with some tasty options.

Both flights were on time and disembarking was just as good as embarking - the business lounges at each airport were very good indeed.

Nothing was too much trouble during any stage of the flight process and Kenyan Airways should be proud of the service and product they fly - they style themselves as The Pride of Africa and we found this notion was well upheld.

There was nothing we could fault and would recommend the Kenya Airways service between Heathrow and Nairobi highly - BA are very good but Kenya Airways better still.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/25/a5/58/40/anse1855.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ANSE1855,ANSE1855 wrote a review Aug 2017,ANSE1855,"Beaulieu, United Kingdom",61 contributions,44 helpful votes,London - Nairobi,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r518914248-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Dream service on Dreamliner,Date of travel: July 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Disappointing experience. OK the plane didn't crash there is at least that but otherwise the quality of comfort was poor.
Firstly it was impossible to try and block emergency aisle seats (I am nearly 2M tall). I did go on-line just before the stated 30 hours before take-off and found virtually all the seats already pre-booked so we weren't even able to sit together as a family.This is very poor service. If there is a stated 30 hour time then this should be respected. I would have paid extra for aisle seats but this option was not available.
Leg-room is minuscule. The seats were rock hard and my bum was numb after one hour. My video screen and headphone combo was broken on the way out and also didn't work on the way back. So the main areas of comfort for long-haul were sadly lacking.The cabin-crew looked rather uninterested in the problem of video and seemed to imply there are always loads of seats where it doesn't work properly so it's just bad luck.

"This was a relatively short (4 1/2 hour) flight in one of the airline's Embraer 190s. It's a lovely plane: new, spotless and very quiet. The seats were like those in US domestic first class or Icelandair Saga Class. They were arranged 1 - 2. They were comfortable for this daytime flight. I could imagine that the overheads might get overfull if the cabin were full -- it's really only possible to put full size carry-ons on the right-hand side of the plane.

What really set this flight apart was the crew. Erick (our cabin attendant) was extremely friendly and very helpful from the start. He remembered my first name and used it throughout rthe flight. He kept checking whether any of us needed anything. European and US airlines could learn a lot from watching this Kenya Airways team at work. Very impressive

I had ordered a VGML which was on board and tasty

"The flight was ok, business seats not the best and with little privacy (although I was lucky with the people I sat next too). The food was ok as were the cabin crew.

The reason for picking Kenya Air was the cost and they are competitive.

"My return flight to Nairobi from Dar is just over an hour. As we were heading to the airport, I got an email saying the flight would be delayed by 50 minutes. OK, not big deal, I've no connecting flight to catch. When we checked in, we again were told that the flight would be delayed by 50 minutes. The departure monitor showed the delay, but after the new tame came and left, the entire flight was pulled off the screen altogether. I started checking online and got much more, what turned out to be, accurate info from various flight status sites. Long story short: Flight finally left about 3 hours late. It seems this info was available on generic suites, but KQ didn't bother to tell its customers at the airport.

The flight itself was what I expected. No problems. Polite friendly flight crew. The relatively new KQ arrivals hall is nice and well organized. I got thru immigrations, bag pickup, and customs in less than 30 minutes -- of course it was 1:30 am -- so we were the only flight arriving at the time.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChipK539,Chip K wrote a review Aug 2017,Chip K,"Nairobi, Kenya",79 contributions,25 helpful votes,Dar es Salaam - Nairobi,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r518667989-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Timely flights -- seemingly not a priority,Date of travel: August 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"With reference to our recent Kenya Airways flight experience I believe that you would benefit from my personal observations and comments regarding your services.

Flight KQ492 Dar-NBO- 03/08/2017
Overall a pleasant flight, but the in flight entertainment system was not working in our seats on the emergency exits or from what I could see about (4) fours in front of us. I asked the flight attendant to check for us, she told me it was being rebooted. It never worked for the entire flight.

Flight KQ760 NBO-JNB- 03/08/2017
Overall a pleasant flight the 787 aircraft is a delight, however I would suggest you ask your Executive Chef to travel on one of the flights. To be offered a “poached egg” with green bean/pea stew and fried cubed potatoes was to say the least disgusting. I could have played golf with the egg which was cooked so long it might have bounced. Not an experience you would want to remember.

Flight KQ 765 JNB-NBO 09/08/2017
The check in was an experience I have never in 40 years of flying encountered before, the person who designed and implemented this process should be fired.
1. Stand in line to have your bags weighed, not only that but hand over your passports while the airport rep completes many details in a log book, after which she gives me a paper to hand in at the check in desk.
2. At the check in desk the airport rep again takes our passports and weighs the luggage, and completes her checks and issues the boarding cards. ( Not sure why she needed to re-weigh the luggage).
3. We are then instructed to carry our bags to a different check in desk where they offer to plastic wrap our bags, a) our bags are already wrapped, b) the machine is not working as the man can’t find an extension cable. We are told leave our suitcases at this point unattended- ‘not a problem’ we are told as I was unhappy to leave them in the middle of the check-in hall. “no problem’ we are again told the security man is watching them. He must be very clever I stated as he is facing away from the luggage texting on his phone.

4. We board the plane on time… however it soon becomes apparent that all the passengers who had been clearly required to remove excess luggage from the suitcases, have now gained considerable hand luggage… as what was coming on board was not going to fit in the overhead lockers, I felt sorry for the flight attendants who were under considerable pressure to assist passenger until the ground staff who were the same ones that had checked us in came on board to assist.
5. The consequence was a slightly delayed departure.
6. On arrival in Nairobi only a few minutes late due to tail winds, we were further delayed as we had to wait a considerable time to get a parking space.
7. Once off the aircraft we moved quickly through the airport, with great assistance from security officials as we were now getting late for our connecting flight to Dar es Salaam KQ480.
8. The PA system was announcing final calls for the flight, the TV screens were showing final call we arrived at the gate.
9. We were met with the most unfriendly KQ agent who told us the flight had left, as I could clearly see the aircraft at the gate and as the PA system was till announcing the flight and the TV screens still showing final call, I was shocked that she refused to board us. As I pointed out from her system she must have been able to see our connecting flight had landed, she must have known we were on that flight, but no help was offered.
10. We joined a queue at KQ Flight Service, with two agents working and a line backing up through the Duty Free area, after 35 minutes in the line the agent without any apology changed our tickets to the KQ482 departing at 11:00hrs. I was then told to return to the desk at 08:30hrs to collect Breakfast Vouchers, I could not believe she was serious!
11. We collected our Breakfast vouchers at 08:30hrs, as instructed and were directed to gate 23 Avanti Restaurant for breakfast. On arrival we found one lady behind the counter and approx 40 guests already seated. We asked about the breakfast and were told the breakfast was “egg, sausage and bread with tea or coffee” we were told to take a seat and someone would come to take our order. After 15 minutes and the arrival of more than 30 more people from another delayed flight I asked when we could order, she was now very confused and under pressure and told us she had already ordered our breakfast, another ten minutes and it arrived, a one egg overcooked omelette and the second one one overcooked fried egg both with a sausage and two slices of toast, no butter no preserve, no condiments on the table.
12. We eventually went to the boarding gate delighted our journey was almost over. I did bring to the attention of your agent at the gate that as well as welcoming KQ premier passengers to priority board she might also add inconvenienced passengers as a gesture that KQ was sorry for the inconvenience… I don’t think she liked my suggestion.
13. No problem we departed on time and arrived in Dar es Salaam on time at 12:15hrs.
14. Waiting for our luggage in Dar es Salaam one piece arrived on the conveyor belt, we waited until the belt finished for the second one, it was not there and went to lost luggage to start the process for our missing piece.
15. OH! to our surprise the one missing luggage had come on the KQ 480. So you also allow unaccompanied baggage on your flights, I understood this was against all the security recommendations.

If you have taken the time read through this letter, and digested the contents you will appreciate the distress the actions of your employees cause to your passengers. Not a single apology throughout this ordeal. I thought I would bring this to your attention as I am sure your passengers face these problems every day, and even though in the big picture this is a minor delay in your eyes, you can clearly see how the endless problems arise from simple issues, You have a big job on your hands to turn this around but I hope you manage it. I think it will be some time before I try again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allaboutholidaysUK,allaboutholidaysUK wrote a review Aug 2017,allaboutholidaysUK,"Dar es Salaam, Tanzania",70 contributions,18 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Dar es Salaam,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r518651869-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Poor Customer Service,Date of travel: August 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The Aircraft was a smaller single aisled Boeing 738. Very cramped for space. The service levels of KQ have a taken a beating for sure in the past one year that i last traveled. The Food portions have grown very small and you are hungry within no time, the OnBoard beverage service has been curtailed severely. Earlier they used to have a second top up round of service for the beverages in which they would give 2 doubles of any liquour of choice per round but now it is only one round of service with very limited choice . If you need a top up then you go and ask for the same at rear where the stewards sit. Overall below average for the money they charge. I paid INR 49600 for 2 way ticket which was almost 25% more for a pared down service.

Another thing i want to share is the seating at the emergency exits. I noticed a bulky 70 year or so old man in middle seat and his more bulkier, burqa( Bui Bui) clad wife seated at the window seat of the emergency exit row. I wonder how on earth would the couple react or be of assistance in case of an emergency or a water landing ???

"We were visiting Kenya and had many internal flights to take so opted for Kenyan Airways. The trip started with cancellation of KQ 211 on 30th July. The office booking team of Kenya was very cooperative in routing the group of 34 on Emirates transiting through Dubai. Internal flights on Kenya Airways to Victoria fall, return via Zambia to Seychelles and back were all good flights cooperative staff, clean planes, on time flights and decent food. The mess up was instructions on special meals were all mixed up as a result vegetarians were on the first sector got only bread and butter. The staff was very cooperative helped with getting the food preferences corrected for next flight which was good .

However our experience on the return from Nairobi was pathetic. The flight was delayed for over an hour even when the plane was there we were waiting for connecting passengers on delayed flights coming in. We had a connection to Delhi from Mumbai and even on telling the boarding staff of this got the reply why did you not use our interline partner Jet Airways? Our request to send a message to Air India that a group joining he flight to Delhi is on a delayed flight got no attention from them. Who are they to question which flight we use!!!!

In Flight service, very arrogant attendants who clearly showed that they do not like doing the job with their attitude. So move over get another job but do not trouble the passengers. I heard a fellow traveller tell the attendant if he change the preferred meal to another meal. Reply was a curt NO when at least 4 passengers around where we were sitting opted not to take any meal.

After some 45 minutes a member of the ground staff comes in and tells everyone of that flight on an individual basis that they need to bring in a spare part with the flight of 21.00 hrs. Replacing it will only take 30 minutes and then we'll be on our way... it was said...

The flight arrived as scheduled and apparently the part was delivered because it was announced that it would take some 45 minutes before we could board. However, after some one and a half hour the final announcement came that ""we regret that the service is cancelled"".

This is no fun of course but the worst part was yet to come. The KQ ladies who had to arrange hotel and shuttles for everyone was suddenly attacked by some 100 passengers and, boy oh boy, many of those were not friendly. It's amazing how people think they're the only ones and only their appointments are important. The lady was really trying to first find an extra KQ flight, then an alternative flight but some passengers wouldn't even let her finish her phone calls. It's really embarrassing how some people treated the KQ ground staff...

I managed to get a hotel name out of her and didn't wait for the taxi. Was at the hotel at around 01.00 hrs and had myself put on one of the later flights of the next day. Got an upgrade to business.

All in all, not pleasant that the flight was cancelled but these things happen. What was worse were the other passengers. Kudos to the lady from KQ who kept here cool.

"I was reluctant to use Kenya Airways as I had heard not great things about them, particularly in terms of being on time.
However, circumstances forced my hand and I flew them to Nairobi and back.
I will admit I was pleasantly surprised!
Firstly, I have flown several different airline versions of the 787 and this one had by far the best legroom - it was so comfortable for me at 185cm.
The flight from BKK to NBO originates in China, so the flight attendants were all Chinese (who are excellent) and it had a lot of noisy Chinese passengers already aboard (who are not so great!).
Food was great, entertainment good, overall a great experience.

"Kenya air over books their business class seats. When you get to the airport and check in, they may tell you that we are overbooked in business class and you need to find another flight or move to economy class.
There were others who booked economy class only to find out that they were overbooked in that class as well and had to find another flight.

"I never write reviews on social platforms but I really feel this is necessary so that people can be warned never to use this airline.

On the 24th on June I travelled to Dubai from Cape Town.

Despite it being a long trip, I was in pretty good spirits when I arrived in Dubai. That is till I went to claim my luggage..... and my troubles began.

Almost an hour later, I had to leave the airport with Dnata assuring me that my luggage would be brought to me once found.

This was 2 months ago!

I had spoken to various people at Dnata who on turn allowed me to check of if my baggage was in their lost and found. Once I realised it was not there, I was told to speak to someone at Kenya Airways office.

I met Dennis who assures me that my luggage would be found within a week. Many emails, whatsapp messages and phone calls later have all proved useless as my luggage has still not been returned and I have been passed on to everyone in the Kenya Airways office. I have been given every excuse under the sun including the elections that has just occurred in Kenya!

To say that I am disappointed with their service is a major understatement. All my life including work material that I needed was in my bag.

So do yourself a favour, DO NOT FLY WITH KENYA AIRWAYS!!!

"I flew Kenya Airways business class.  I have nothing particularly negative to say about the inflight business class service which was quite standard.  However my experience with their baggage handling was less than satisfactory.  Kenya Airways falls far short of their sky team partners’ in handling baggage issues.Upon arrival in Lagos, I discovered that my suit case was damaged.  After spending an hour to get to fill in a form and have the person in charge of baggage to witness the damage, I asked what the next step would be.   I was told that, as the manager would have to see the suitcase, I should return to the airport the next day to show it to him.   What!  I live over 50 km away from the airport and that would mean a 100 km only  return trip to ""show and tell"".......  I decided to wait at the airport until the manager was available - which meant another hour wait.   Over one hour later, I showed the case to the manager.  He told me to bring it back the next day! What! What! What!!! I explained that I had purposely waited to see him due to the problem of distance/Lagos traffic etc. and asked why he needed it the next day after seeing today.   He said for ""inspection and repairs"".  I asked him to have a Kenya airways staff to accompany me to my waiting vehicle where I would empty my suitcase and hand it over to their care.  He refused.  He also informed me that, if I could not return to the airport the next day myself, I could afford to send my driver to deposit the suitcase at the airport.I have sent a written complaint three times (incident  reference # 170724-000206 to Kenya Airways guest support  to obtain the their support.   They twice wrote to «sincerely apologise for the disappointment gained.» and both times referred me back to their Lagos office (which happens to be at the airport 100 km away/return trip) or simply ignored my email. Ironically, each time I was sent a feedback survey....  I tried the Kenya Airways 24 hour chatline - after being first in queue and  waiting for an agent for 20 minutes (three times), I gave up.Kenya Airways, ""the Pride of Africa"" is of the opinion that I can afford the stress, time and money to make a 200 km:  to drop my baggage for damage inspection then collect it after ""possible repairs"" otherwise I should repair or replace it myself.I have had baggage problems with other Sky Team partner airlines - which is inevitable since I travel a great deal - but they have always been resolved in a respectful and professional manner   as well as with consideration  and minimum discomfort on my side - I actually believe them when they refer to me as a ""valued customer"".   This is certainly not the case with Kenya Airways once one has a baggage problem.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/99/default-avatar-2020-40.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M0m0O,Momo O wrote a review Aug 2017,Momo O,ACCRA,6 contributions,11 helpful votes,Paris - Lagos,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r514642348-Kenya_Airways-World.html,200 KM TRIP FOR BAGGAGE REPAIRS REQUIRED BY KQ,Date of travel: July 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We flew KQ861 from Hong Kong to Nairobi via Bangkok. We had a quick 1 hour 15 minute stop in Bangkok.
The flight to Bangkok was operated by a Bangkok based crew while there was a crew change at Bangkok. Typically it's 2.5 hours to Bangkok and 8 hours to Nairobi from Bangkok. Passengers to Nairobi were NOT allowed to disembark at Bangkok.
The food was mediocre, but was generally OK for an airline food. There were 2 options and 2 meals were served in the flight.
The crew were not too warm and friendly and rushed you to make your choice for food and also you had to wait as you called for crew.
We flew on the 787-8 Dreamliner which is a very technologically advanced aircraft. The inflight entertainment was average with top films but also films which didn't seem too appealing. However there is a lot of info in the IFE system.
The seat was slightly uncomfortable with minimal legroom. And something about the aircraft was throughout the 12-13 hours I was on it, it was so very stuffy and was hot.

"We arrive at 1am at Nairobi international airport in Kenya.  Arrival guy says go to transfer desk. We walk across entire airport. Kenyan airways woman at transfer desk says I have to pay $20 transit visa per person good for 72 hours to just to go pick up my bags at baggage claim and then drop them off at other terminal.  A disgusting scam by Kenya. She says only 1 of us should go to pay $20 instead of all 4 of us at $80 for transit visas she says. I ask her if I should go now and she says yes.  I go through passport control pay the $20 ransom, take my bags outside of the airport, walk down the street where cars are dropping people off as I push 4 bags weighing a total of 100 pounds plus in a cart 1/3 of a mile to this next terminal. I go into this terminal and re-check bags.  I get to the bag screening area where they scan your check in bags for bombs, etc. and 1 guy at the baggage screening conveyor who checks and X-Rays bags for under the plane is sleeping. No joke. He was asleep for the hour plus I was there. I enter the main check in hall at this terminal at 2am and the guy says they don't open the counter until 4am. Ar this point I am fuming. I tell them to hold my bags, he says he can't. I say to call the transfer desk and ask why the lady didn't tell me they didn't open untill 4am, he says he has no phone.  Meanwhile my wife and kids are wondering where I am thinking I was going to be like 10 minutes and it is going on 1 1/2 hours.  I finally get an employee to go back to their terminal and tell them what is happening. I finally check in bags at 3:45am and convince guy to print all our boarding passes even though my wife and the kids are not present but I have their passports. Now...2 weeks later, coming home. Fly back into Nairobi again. 8 hour layover so we pay for a lounge to sleep.  5am flight time.  I stand in line to talk to Kenyan Airways people at the transfer desk (30 min. in line and only 4 people ahead of me).  People there tell me to go to Turkish Airlines transfer desk at 2:30am. I do, no one is there. 3am, no one is there. 3:30, no one is there.  I have my lounge person keep calling first a supervisor, then a manager. They say they are sending someone. No one is showing and the flight time is approaching fast. I knew the ridiculous process shed of me of going through multiple security checks, going outside airport, etc. I finally say screw it and tell my wife and the kids to stay put. I go through passport control (only one guy is there who was sleeping, I had to wake him up).  This time they don't charge me $20.  Get bags at baggage claim, they have been just sitting there in the open for hours. Walk across street and now hundreds of people in line to check in at new terminal. Stand in line for an hour.

"nice aircrafts, friendly cabin crew and good inflight entertainment. But they Failed to alert me when my flight got cancelled/ rescheduled by 12 hours! Just by chance i called the airport to check flight status and was told its delayed by 12 hours. With difficulty i got a local Kenya airways number but they couldnt help much and they too were incontactable after a few hours- the number was taken over by Japan airways! we had to spend another unplanned night in Mumbai and when i asked for a letter confirming the delay to claim insurance, this was not provided at that time, despite repeat reminders. I did finally get the letter a week later on email after another call.

"Flight cancelled resulting in 24 hours of our holiday lost. Luggage lost for 5 days (2 of us) and 9 days i.e. the whole trip (1 of us).

This was a disastrous start to the trip of a lifetime for my nieces and me. On arrival at Charles de Gaulle airport the info board was displaying 'delayed' only to change to 'cancelled' for our flight to Nairobi.

The airport staff didn't have a clue what to do with hundreds of people stranded - there was absolute chaos. No provision was made in terms of information or refreshments and we had to queue for 3 hours to be told our fate which (in our case) was to fly to The Seychelles overnight, spend 8 hours stranded there (not allowed out) and arrive in Nairobi the next evening.

Then we were informed that our luggage was missing. We were given $100 each (which had to be changed to Kenyan shillings with commission charges) to buy clothes, shoes, toiletries, mosquito repellant, malaria medication etc etc. Didn't cover our expenses at all so we had to spend more money.

This resulted in losing 24 hours of our holiday and one night's prepaid 5* hotel accommodation in Nairobi. And the luggage saga as above.

I'm returning to Nairobi next year but I will never fly with this airline again",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/15/99/1d/33/d7055qcjanej.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D7055QCjanej,Jane J wrote a review Jul 2017,Jane J,,27 contributions,17 helpful votes,Paris - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r503164619-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Terrible experience,Date of travel: July 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"OMG! We flew 4 times with this airline and only had one good flight.

our first check in raised the first red flag... unhelpful grumpy girl at check in who looking back now I can tell knew that there was a problem with our next flight but was obviously too hard for her to deal with so she told us to collect our boarding passes for our connecting flight at the next airport - also, she was no help seating our family together - the 5 of us were spread out all over the plane - was NOT happy that my two girls were seated away for us was a 1am flight and they were both seated in the middle of two strangers (men??) when we complained she told us to take it up with the cabin staff -ha - joke that was - they gave even less help - it took my husband to have to ask a stranger to move for at least our two girls to sit next to eachother.

once we arrived at the next airport and when to get our boarding passes for our flight leaving in an hour we were met with HUGE line that was not moving and as time was running out we had to push to the front of the line which understandably did not go down well with everyone else.

were told there was a problem with our tickets even though when i looked on the screen i could see our names, flight details AND payment amount... took a lot of pressure and talking to finally get our boarding passes (even though our baggage was already check in this didnt seem to bother them) and we had to run to board the plane in time.

there was another american couple there having the exact same issues - they were forced to pay and extra US$500 CASH to get their boarding passes - thankfully they had the cash on them as of course the airline didnt take cards?? and wanted USD?? oh and they refused to give the couple a receipt?? rort!!

our next 2 flights went ok as i had our agent back home confirm everything was ok beforehand. Just had to put up with grumpy air hostesses.

out of the 4 flights we had 1 ok aircraft.

be careful hopping on last - they dont seem to have cabin baggage allowances and EVERYONE brings on a suitcase size case which they then fill up the overhead lockers with......

food was terrible - dont risk it.

wouldn't fly with them again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/23/default-avatar-2020-28.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V1415,V1415 wrote a review Jul 2017,V1415,"Sydney, Australia",47 contributions,24 helpful votes,Johannesburg - Arusha,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r502666731-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Never again!,Date of travel: June 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Flight attendants, Leah and Vivian were amazing, we conversed as if we had known each other for years, they were very hospitable, God bless you ladies.

On return from Nairobi to Dubai, things took a different twist, I witnessed one of the MOST rude cabin crews ever , I didn't get her name but she had short hair and wore glasses, and sized people with her eyes and never apologized, she literally, disrespectfully, folded her arms as she addressed some people on the flight.
The potatoes for the potato salad were raw and the mixed vegetables were getting spoiled, however the mash and the stew were on point.

"This was my first time with Kenya Airways and after reading the reviews I was really not looking forward to the flight. But let me start off by saying -  there is no reason for not flying Kenya Airways. The plane is an Embraer E190 which is certainly not the most comfortable plane available but for a semi-long haul flight it is tolerable. The embarking and disembarking was extremely efficient. Inflight personnel was professional, smart and friendly. The meals were typical airline and even good on return light (KQ792) .

"We had a great time on our 9 day vacation tour of Nairobi, Mt. Kenya, Sweet waters, Lake Elmenteita and Masai Mara. The hospitality was excellent with amazing service of ever smiling people. We had formed an impression of Kenya being incredible with all our initial apprehensions put to rest until our debacle with Kenya Airways at Dubai.

We were eventually put on the Oman Air flight of 2250 hours after a 17 hours ordeal at the Dubai Airport. We arrived at Muscat totally exhausted, filthy (without bathing), restless, wistful and a lot of regret of using Kenya Airways for our holiday.

Generally, your staff at the Dubai office and particularly the Station Manager Mr. Dennis Monari was absolutely ineffectual and noncommittal to our needs. Finally, it was the Dnata Connection Desk staff & Duty Supervisor appreciating our plight since 0615 hours took it onto themselves to get us confirmations on the Oman Air flight ETD 2250 hrs.

It has been a harrowing and tormenting experience for me and my wife all of 17 hours we spent at the Dubai T1 because of Kenya Airways inefficiency and lack of sensitivity.

Having braved the time, the least we expect from Kenya Airways now is a compensation for the Ordeal we went through for no fault of ours. Though, this may not pay for the total discomfort and distress we have experienced but may lessen our pain and improve our impression about Kenya Airways as a whole.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/597bhavanam,Bhavana M wrote a review Jul 2017,Bhavana M,,1 contribution,2 helpful votes,Nairobi - Muscat Governorate,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r498968742-Kenya_Airways-World.html,17 hours of hopelessness,Date of travel: June 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We had a great time on our 9 day vacation tour of Nairobi, Mt. Kenya, Sweet waters, Lake Elmenteita and Masai Mara. The hospitality was excellent with amazing service of ever smiling people. We had formed an impression of Kenya being incredible with all our initial apprehensions put to rest until our debacle with Kenya Airways at Dubai.

We were eventually put on the Oman Air flight of 2250 hours after a 17 hours ordeal at the Dubai Airport. We arrived at Muscat totally exhausted, filthy (without bathing), restless, wistful and a lot of regret of using Kenya Airways for our holiday.

Generally, your staff at the Dubai office and particularly the Station Manager Mr. Dennis Monari was absolutely ineffectual and noncommittal to our needs. Finally, it was the Dnata Connection Desk staff & Duty Supervisor appreciating our plight since 0615 hours took it onto themselves to get us confirmations on the Oman Air flight ETD 2250 hrs.

It has been a harrowing and tormenting experience for me and my wife all of 17 hours we spent at the Dubai T1 because of Kenya Airways inefficiency and lack of sensitivity.

Having braved the time, the least we expect from Kenya Airways now is a compensation for the Ordeal we went through for no fault of ours. Though, this may not pay for the total discomfort and distress we have experienced but may lessen our pain and improve our impression about Kenya Airways as a whole.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/597bhavanam,Bhavana M wrote a review Jul 2017,Bhavana M,,1 contribution,2 helpful votes,Nairobi - Muscat Governorate,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r498968742-Kenya_Airways-World.html,17 hours of hopelessness,Date of travel: June 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I honestly hope someone senior and with some impact on the structure of the organisation reads this. Then again maybe no one at kenya airways actually cares how poor the African routes are.

Strongly recommend not to fly Kenya Airways. Flight out of Nairobi was delayed by 4 hours with very little communication and passengers waiting to be told what's happening.

Flight back from Harare was cancelled whilst at the airport. Put in the next flight which was 5 hours later, which was also delayed by another 3 hours blaming a lack of an engineer and paper work issues. The old tired Embraer don't have tvs that work. The air hostess did apologise though.

All in all a 8 hour delay, missed connections, missed meetings and kenya airways twitter handle saying sorry for the inconvenience caused. Am seeking compensation and will post how my recovery efforts go.

They need to get serious with their passengers and see that the reason for their demise is structural, passenger loads, faulty planes etc. Those of you who can fly alternative carriers please consider. When we were waiting for the cancellations and postponement ground staff mentioned that this is now becoming normal. Having experienced 12 hours delays for what should have been 3 hour flights is not acceptable",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/bf/ba/09/madhav-b.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/478madhavb,Madhav B wrote a review Jul 2017,Madhav B,"Nairobi, Kenya",66 contributions,89 helpful votes,Nairobi - Harare,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r498964011-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Worst flying experience with kenya airways ! ,Date of travel: July 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Last November we went to Mombasa via Amsterdam Amsterdam is a hiuge airport and you need to allow plenty of time as security and distances to gates takes ages. Going out we had 3 hours which gave us enough time but returning the airline said 60 minutes was enough it is NOT. I need wheel chair assistance but that was not really the problem. We thought we were still in transit but had to go back through customs where the queue was 25 minutes. We had not removed water given in the plane from our bags so that delayed us further. We ran to the gate as it was shutting and our 2 friends were behind us we pleaded to them to wait which fortunately they did but this was very stressful and others on the flight missed the connection.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/bb/bb/6b/rosie-d.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/738rosied,Rosie D wrote a review Jun 2017,Rosie D,"Huddersfield, United Kingdom",40 contributions,46 helpful votes,London - Mombasa,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r496811383-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Flight to Mombasa via amsterdam,Date of travel: December 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I had to take a flight from Harare to Nairobi Kenya then another flight to Bangkok. It was cheaper than my other options but I regret the option. There was a considerable difference between the planes that are used. It is a lottery what standard of plane you might get. I suspect there are limited servicing of the seating and entertainment components on some of the planes. On arrival there was not a plane to take to Bangkok. so the passengers were shuttled between Hotel and airport with very little information. There was no public announcement so it required the ability to find someone who knew what was going on to get the right advice. Very confusing and very disappointing level of customer service.

"KQ (as they are known) is a reasonable carrier but there is much room for improvement. Being almost a monopolist in east-Africa makes that they sometimes give the impression they couldn't be bothered...

Although they like to give the passenger the impression they're the best thing what could've happened to them, the service is average to poor, the food is very mediocre and the equipment needs (superficial) maintenance. Panels are loose, tray-tables are sagging. We can only hope that major structural maintenance is under control.

There's no consistency in their operations, sometimes you have to wait to get pulled to a gate upon arrival, sometimes they're allowed to taxi themselves to the bridge. Sometimes you get to a bridge at a gate, sometimes you need to bus back tot the terminal. They claim that's all due to external circumstances, but forcing the people to stay in their seats after engine shut-down 'cause stewardess needs to walk through the cabin to check the front door... take a leaf from other airlines and learn.

Finally, the lounge. Being a Frequent Flyer I see this lounge sometimes every week. The food is dismal, choice is limited and never varies. It's too busy from time to time and the bathrooms are an afterthought. Not worth it...

However, there's hardly any choice in east-Africa.

"Having had a very good flight on this airline from Johannesburg to Nairobi (the flight was half empty), I was completely unprepared for the leg from Nairobi to Hanoi.  It was absolutely packed with travellers continuing on to China. The window seat I had booked was already very full with a large lady conversing with her equally large friend in the middle seat.  I quickly decided not to argue with them and took the aisle seat, at least thinking that I would be able to move more freely during the night as there was no way I could have got past them without disturbing them. It was a lovely new aircraft but the seats are VERY close, even for economy.  I am extremely short (1.57m / 5'2"") and had to sleep with my legs bent up towards my nose rather than being able to fit my knees straight behind the seat in front of me :(Although the plane was new, my ""on-board entertainment"" was disobliging and wouldn't work, the food was absolutely inedible - mainly some kind of starch and overcooked veggies. Though, to be fair, I don't usually feel like eating after midnight. By the time the flight landed I felt completely battered.I often fly, and usually love flying, but this time I couldn't wait for the flight to end.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/c6/46/72/barbara-m.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/629BarbaraM,Barbara M wrote a review Jun 2017,Barbara M,"Broederstroom, South Africa",73 contributions,18 helpful votes,Nairobi - Hanoi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r496488215-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Worst flight I've had!,Date of travel: April 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"If finances allow, upgrade to Business Class.  It makes flying long haul pleasurable.  From the minute you check in using priority boarding you whizz through the airport queues and before you know it you are settling into your flatbed seat with a glass of champagne.  After takeoff the lights are dimmed and you recline in your seat/bed with a large pillow and fluffy blanket.  Later breakfast is served.....a choice of hot food is given as well as cereal, fruit, croissants and yogurt.  More drinks are offered and newspapers distributed.  Lunch is a choice of hot food, laid out on white starched table cloths.  Very tasty and so different from the offerings in economy.  Off the aircraft first and through the fast track at Immigration.  On arrival at the carousel, our luggage with priority tags were waiting.  Fantastic and unfortunately the 8 hours passed by too quickly!

"Miserable customer service. I was the last person being served lunch since my seat was right at the end and the amazing flight that this is, ran out of food! None of the flight attendants had the courtesy to even come and offer an extra piece of bread!
On the flight back - I was running a fever and asked the flight attendant for a panadol repeatedly and got snapped at! Was finally given one after almost an hour!
The flight was to halt at Nairobi to pick more passengers and another person was allotted the same seat as mine. To fix their mistake, Instead of asking the new person to take another seat- they got me to change my seat (even though Id been sitting there for the last 5 hours)! And they didn't even bother to clean the seat for the next guy! (Mind you I was sick- with a cold and a cough!- which I did bring up- but it didn't seem to bother them!)

"I use this service frequently as I work in Zambia but I am originally from Kenya. The service is average mostly due to the staff lacking. The staff could be a little more polite. They often act like it is a burden assisting you in the simplest of tasks like getting you a blanket.

The gate at Lusaka sometimes closes 2 hours before so you should aim to be there 3 hours before. There are often few Kenya Airways staff on the ground or the office at the airport at Lusaka and therefore may be hard to get assistance.

The flight is ok if you get a direct. Otherwise you may have a short stopover in Harare. It is not too bad as it is only a short time on the tarmac.

I've flown Kenyan Airways before in the old beat up 777's that used to ply the route between Paris and Nairobi and included things like ash trays in the seats. The new 787's are a wonderful upgrade. With fully lie flat business class seats and plenty of plugs for getting some work done the change is remarkable. Even the food and wine selection has improved considerably. My only quibble is the entertainment options which are fairly weak. Still this miles better than the aircraft they replaced.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/c8/2b/09/mpk17.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mpk17,mpk17 wrote a review Jun 2017,mpk17,Paris,67 contributions,55 helpful votes,Paris - Johannesburg,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r496403598-Kenya_Airways-World.html,New 787's are great!,Date of travel: June 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Everything about this flight was unremarkable, the same as all my other flights in economy, except that when they came around to serve drinks they gave out 2 slightly larger (noticeably larger) bags of mixed nuts (not just the standard peanuts), not just a single tiny bag like you usually get. And, when I ordered red wine they gave me 2 bottles instead of just the standard one and they didn't open them like they often do, like they anticipate that you are going to leave the plane with it so they open it so you are more obligated to drink it on the plane. Kenya Airways did not do this. Even more remarkably, the wine was actually so good that I just wanted to drink both bottles.

"Travel on a fairly regular basis to Kenya. Last 4 trips have been on BA (premium economy ). I like to the day time flight on BA out of Heathrow  it gives us  a late evening in Nairobi . Alas, now at terminal 3, which in my view is the worst terminal  at Heathrow. And at nearly £1200 each for BA decided to give KQ business a try as they  were doing a deal for Business and internal flights, which we had 5 , 2 in Business . Reviews of KQ were not that positive on the various websites. However,  Check in, super smooth and fast track into the Lounge , which was very good and  set the tone for the flight. Staff,  Attentive and professional , none obtrusive  service through out  the night  flight. Day time flight back to Heathrow as was even better. Bar set up for self service on the flight after the main meal which should be the norm. Overall worth the extra money . Internal flights on KQ were good and apart from the Mombasa to Nairobi which was 40 minutes late, everything went well.  The Lounge in Nairobi  for out short flight  to Kisumu was good . The Lounge at Mombasa prior to the flight back to Jomo  is very poor. Food was appalling and cold . You have to pay for Wifi ( apart from the first 15 minutes, why bother. You have to pay for alcohol and a very nice  person spent 15 minutes seeking a Tusker for me, which was warm. Plenty of boxes on display which you can purchase and they will be microwaved for  you! . The Lounge at Jomo the next day prior to the flight to London was a little better. Although, we must have got there at the end of breakfast . Had to chase down staff for plates and cutlery   and food!. at least the Wifi was free! . Apart from the moans re the Lounges in Kenya I was impressed by the over all service from KQ and suspect that BA are not going to tempt me back in future flights to Kenya.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TCM222,TCM222 wrote a review Jun 2017,TCM222,"Bourne, United Kingdom",35 contributions,16 helpful votes,London - Nairobi,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r496076073-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Positive experince in Business,Date of travel: May 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"On a direct flight from Lagos to Nairobi, in April this year I arrived at my destination without my suitcase. When I went to the airline service desk to find out what to do about it, I was met with a stony, nonchalant and dis-interested customer service agent who advised me that my suitcase had been scanned on to the plane and so it must be somewhere. She dispatched someone off in search and I waited about 30 minutes  but the suitcase was not to be found. I was given a piece of paper with a reference number and told to contact them the following day for an update. I asked if they could provide me with an emergency overnight kit and she said no! Thankfully the wonderful staff at the Villa Rosa Kempinski Hotel provided me with some emergency supplies, and kept chasing the airline the following day and my suitcase was finally located and arrived in on a flight at midnight the following day (30 hours later). Unfortunately the airline could not arrange to have the suitcase delivered to my hotel in time for me to check out the following day so I had to pay USD 50 to have it collected from the airport. I asked for this sum to be reimbursed and the airline refused. I pushed back and they said they would only refund me USD 30. I am still waiting for the refund and the flight was on April 5th! Will never fly with this airline again. The staff were unhelpful, unfriendly and completely disinterested in the fact that I was inconvenienced.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/19/61/79/c0/maireads2018.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maireads2018,Mairead S wrote a review Jun 2017,Mairead S,"Sydney, Australia",67 contributions,44 helpful votes,Lagos - Nairobi,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r493269101-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Lost Luggage,Date of travel: April 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"A good airline but need to improve on his fleets to Lagos Nigeria. Flying back to Lagos from Nairobi was a bad experience because we flew in absolute fear with the condition of the airline even when you are on the Business Class seat.
The interior was very bad to the extend that you feel the seat is going to drop of the airline flight number KQ 532.

Flying from Nairobi to Dubai was so wonderful and interior is okay and cool.

The business lounge in Nairobi was cool but airline never provide hotel for a very long connection of like 28 hours. I had to get a transit visa with a sum of $20 and paid for an hotel in town to the tune of $120, which is not really nice.

"I would like to be able to review our flight from Cape Town to Victoria Falls. However I can't, as it never happened. When we arrived at CPT to check in for our flight we were told that the flight had been cancelled. No prior notice given, nothing on website indicating there was an issue and no explanation for the cancellation provided.  The support we received was wholly inadequate. One person, trying her best but obviously overwhelmed.  We were third in line when we arrived. We got to the front of the line after 20 minutes--and by this time a substantial line up had formed behind us.   We were told there was no way to get to Vic Falls that day, so we would have to fly to JNB, overnight and then travel the next day. Given we had booked into a safari lodge for that night, this cost us about $2000 ( party of 5).  we were told that ground staff in JNB would look after us and make all hotel and meal arrangements. It was probably another 15 minutes before our arrangements in Cape Town were finalized( no idea how long people behind has had to wait!) When we arrived in JNB, the staff there knew nothing about the cancellation and seemed to spend most of their time chatting with colleagues instead of helping customers.  On top of that they were rude.  I understand flights get delayed and even cancelled for circumstances beyond control of airlines.  No idea why our flight was cancelled, but Kenya Airways failed to properly notify us, failed to provide sufficient support in CPT to make arrangements for the passengers and failed to ensure staff in JNB were prepared to assist. My wife reminded me that the only other time she had a flight cancelled in Africa was also Kenya Airways.

Their generous two checked bags policy enabled him to take two very large rucksacks with his tent and sleeping bag in outside pockets plus a large backpack in the cabin. His rucksacks were wrapped in a large garbage bag covering 3/4 of the surface then secured with duct tape allowing customs access to the top which was not locked.

"Flew out of Heathrow on the Boeing Dream Liner. Firstly no seat choice , couldn't even chose window or aisle . I noticed before take off that passenger checks were minimal .. so I left my seat belt visibly undone . Just as I thought the cabin crew were in the jump seats and buckled up for take off before I decided to put it on . Lots of seats were reclined on take off , absolutely bare minimum of safety checks . Food was very nice , a very nice lamb hotpot . However drinks were sparse for such a long flight . Entertainment systems seemed hit and miss. I didnt see anyone who had everything working .However,  safety is the biggest issue . On landing , once again just a vague seat belt check and several seats reclined . It's called the 'pride of Africa', not true in my opinion . If this is the best .. second best must be shocking .

"The only thing I found good about the flight was that the 787 planes they have have fairly reasonable legroom for those of us who have to travel coach. Otherwise, I think Kenya Airways' report card should read ""Can definitely do better"". I was not impressed with their boarding system which seemed quite disorganized and didnt make much sense. The customer service by the crew was ""disinterested"" and the food was edible if one is ravenously hungry. The in-flight entertainment provided a very limited choice in films and tv programs and the earphones didn't work... not even replacements brought by the air steward. However, I do give them credit for taking off on time and reaching the destination 10 minutes early.

This airline did not post a seat map for the flight.  I could not select a seat. It was  assigned at the gate.  They are supposed to be partners with Delta but they were clueless about comfort seat upgrades.  After they made about 10 phone calls I was told inside the terminal that I had to exit the terminal and go to the ticket office to get a comfort seat.  I did that and the ticket office had never heard of comfort seats.  They made about 10 phone calls and then suggested that I pay $100 USD to change my seat.  Not guaranteed it was a comfort seat upgrade I declined and rushed back into the terminal to catch my flight. The food was terrible in flight.

"We had the misfortune of experiencing 'the pride of Africa' on our honeymoon to Vietnam in April 2017.

Our negative and unpleasant experience with this airline culminated in the loss of my wife's luggage upon arrival in Johannesburg. After numerous phone calls and emails, absolutely nothing was done to locate this luggage and eventually the airline merely admitted that it was untraceable. None of our calls were ever returned, we received differing stories of the bag not being loaded first in Hanoi and then in Nairobi. It became quite obvious from the outset that the airline did not care about this problem and could not be bothered to help us.

The flight experience was unprofessional, tardy, and disrespectful towards the passengers. Traveling between Hanoi and Nairobi felt like the passengers were alone on the flight and when the air hostess staff were visible, they were sullen, impatient and obviously cared very little for the wellbeing and comfort of the passengers on board. Upon boarding the flight in Hanoi, we were not greeted by a single staff member. Passengers were sleeping in incorrect seats and no air hostess could be found to assist us. Food was served with an air of contempt and annoyance. The hot breakfast consisted of a stale croissant and fruit. Drinks were served once on the flight. Trays took more than an hour to be cleared. An all round ghastly experience hopefully not to ever be repeated.

We arrived home from an amazing honeymoon with a bitter taste in our mouths and one less bag.... Stay away - not worth the lower cost at all!!!!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/09/8c/ca/aa/jeremy-p.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/764jeremyp,Jeremy P wrote a review Apr 2017,Jeremy P,,14 contributions,10 helpful votes,Hanoi - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r480109311-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Shocking experience - do not fly with them!!,Date of travel: April 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Flight left Nairobi 25 minutes late without a word of explanation. Landing in Amsterdam then was 10 minutes earlier than announced just 15 minutes ago, so cabin staff had to rush to get everybody properly seated and buckled up. Better communication from the flight deck would be in order.

The Dreamliner planes only have business (somewhat old-fashioned seats) and economy class (rather modern seats). No premium economy type option is available. A good headphone is handed out also in economy.

Service levels ok - in a country where the Masai are proud they can do without water for three days, one should perhaps not be surprised that not too many rounds of drinks are served. One can however walk to the galley and ask for a drink. Cabin staff friendly and helpful.

"On our incoming flight our bags did not arrive.
They arrived 2 days later... just in time for our friends wedding... after being rummaged through and some gifts opened.

Outgoing: We were alerted at 1:30 am that our domestic 4am flight to Nairobi had been resheduled to 8:40am. This meant we missed our connecting international flight to Amsterdam at 7:55am.

When speaking to the operator 'Wangare' we were told she would call us back. after waiting an hour still no call. so at 2:30 am we called again to be told 'just get to Nairobi and they will sort you out there'. After spending 2 hours waiting for answers in Nairobi we were told we were booked on the flight the next day. They did offer us a hotel but we have friends in Nairobi so we stayed with them. We were assured our taxi fare would be reimbursed. No surprises that this was later refused.

We were travelling as a family and they had split us all up, luckily the kind air hostesses managed to swap some people around and sit us together.

The plane was cramped and the entertainment limited. the 'continental breakfast' consisted of a packet of nuts and some juice. There was pee on the bathroom floor, when I asked for a blanket for my sleeping baby I was told they were for business class only, and when I asked for some milk... the flight attendant forgot.

The service was slow, unsympathetic and inefficient. Considering all the mistakes they made, it seemed like it was up to us to fix them ourselves.

Despite being 'checked in' by Kenya airways to our final destination in Stockhom, when we reached Amsterdam the KLM flight had no knowledge of us and we had to explain the situation to them. They then reprimanded us for not having checked ourselves in properly!

All in all, what should have been a straightforward 11 hour journey, ended up taking... from 1:30 am monday 24th... to 8pm on tuesday 25th. 43 hours later. No compensation. No upgrade, No sympathy. Nothing.

"Kenya Airways has been a flight passenger Carrier for some time but they still need to get to grips with their timing for boarding and take-offs. Planes are comfortable with good legroom, few turbulence and fewer flight disconnections. Flight attendants are pleasant and approachable and they attend to enquiries promptly. Worthy of mention is their propensity to assist passengers in every way possible, before, during and after one's flight. For example, I twitted the airline about my apprehension that I may not be allowed to fly back with them as my new passport had no South African permanent resident permit inside, they communicated this, with my documents to their Lagos office beforehand, and my return journey was thus without problem.

"My journey to Goa, my final destination, was with Kenya Airways, transit in Mumbai, then onward to Goa with Jet Airways. At the time of booking and also at check-in, my baggage, two suitcases, were booked directly to Goa. However, in Mumbai, I discovered that my luggage had been offloaded in Mumbai, thus requiring my checking-in again in Mumbai. At this point, I discovered that both my suitcases had their zipper pulls cut, obviously with cutters and the locks that I had used discarded in the process. This action has now rendered both my suitcases useless for further use.  While I appreciate that customs may wish to check passengers' baggage, I find it appalling that this is done by damaging passengers' suitcases, and not in the presence of passengers. Fortunately, nothing went missing in my suitcases, although they had been thoroughly rifled through and a gift that I had wrapped had the wrapping damaged. If this has been done by Jet Airways, it is still the ultimate responsibility of Kenya Airways to inform its passengers about formalities undertaken in Mumbai by Jet Airways and to take responsibility for passengers' baggage.  I would not recommend the Jet Airways connection but also feel that Kenya Airways needs to do a lot more towards customer satisfaction. Similarly,  if this damage was done in Kenya, then Kenya Airways owes me an explanation.The return flight to Nairobi was hardly impressive, with the cabin crew who appeared to be in a hurry to chat away in the galley rather than to serve passengers. Dinner trays were not taken away for a long time,  prompting several passengers to take their own trays back to the galley. Blankets were issued to passengers at random  rather than being placed on every passenger's seat.

"Having had a terrible experience with Emirates, my husband and I decided to try Kenya Airways.
The flight times and VFM were great (thanks to Dialaflight services).
Everything was great. It was a calm flight (no screaming kids or massive groups of people connecting in big hubs (like Dubai), the plane was really clean and comfortable and the staff were incredibly nice.
I wouldn't hesitate to both use and recommend Kenya Airways again.
The only down side was that we had to fly from Heathrow and we live in Derby, but that was outweighed by the overall experience.
100% amazing customer experience.

"Was relocating my family and dog to Africa for a job assignment. Found Kenya Airways to be competitively priced, and the Cargo staff in Bangkok did an amazing job with giving us information about animal travel protocols e.g. import/export permits etc. Cargo staff also picked up the animal in Bangkok.

Unfortunately, the regulations of Kenya Airways (unlike European airlines) does not permit the animal to be taken out of the cage to be fed or walked while in transit, which led to our dog being confined in his cage for 30 hours without a chance to relieve himself. Had we known this prior to discovering it on destination we would not have booked. This is animal torture. Thankfully the ground staff in Freetown met me as I excited the aircraft and then facilitated to get the dog out in less than 10 minutes.

Flying with other airlines, the animal is customarily taken out, walked and checked by veterinarian.

Other than the dog incident the airline did not impress -Old aircrafts; bad food and substandard in flight service.

As a comparison we paid 1700$ for the dog ticket to Thailand-Africa with Kenya Airways, while we paid 700$ to return him to Thailand from Africa via Europe with other carriers.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/77/52/b4/araaf.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ARaaf,ARaaf wrote a review Mar 2017,ARaaf,Thailand,126 contributions,56 helpful votes,Bangkok - Freetown,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r467970269-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Torture Pet Travel from Asia to Africa,Date of travel: May 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I had a series of 5 flights with KQ over 10 days on both 737-800s and Embraer 190s.

Overall the standard was high, the cabin crew were always helpful and friendly and the aircraft were all less than 5 years old.

The food was fine on all flights, one doesn't expect that much from economy but all meals were perfectly edible.

Space was comparable to any of the European carriers and the seats were comfortable enough to be able to get a few hours sleep on overnight flights.

My one gripe was with the return from NBO - ACC. Firstly an earlier departure time was posted on the boards in the terminal (luckily I had a long transit so was unaffected) but this later changed to the original time and then a 40 minute delay. We boarded as if we were to depart at the new time and spent close to two hours on board with little information, just that we were waiting for passengers from a connecting flight. We eventually arrived 90 minutes late. Communication on the ground could have been much better.

"Horrible! The second and last time I fly - the cabin crew ignored my repeated requests to lower the cabin temperature of my row 14 - then told me it would take too much time to cool the cabin - with hours remaining in the flight. I sweat the entire flight - it was like a furnace. To make matters worse, they would not bring me bottled water but offered me tap water - which I have been warned against drinking by other stewards of the airline industry. The flight attendant rolled his eyes when I asked for a second glass of water I did not want to ingest - because it may be polluted or contaminated. He told me to wait until food service. EVERY TIME I went to the back of the plane, the flight attendants were eating the food from the cart or were asleep in their seats - folded over. This was for an 8 hour flight! I suffered further because the woman behind me was coughing and sneezing and there was no ventilation to push her germs away. I have been sick with the flu for a week after my hellacious flight.

"I'm writing on behalf of my mother and sister who traveled from Lilongwe to India for my mother's medical checkup. To start with, booking the flight was a roller coaster. Prices kept changing, from the time they received a quotation to the time of payment. The price drastically went up all in a space of less than one month. Top that, their flight was delayed and no reason was given.

The major problem was when they arrived back in Lilongwe (on a Wednesday), they discovered that all of my Mother's luggage was missing. After reporting the matter to the officials, they were only able to trace one of the bags which was apparently left in Mozambique. This bag reached Lilongwe on Saturday and lucky enough it was protected in plastic wrap. After inquiring for the other bag they kept telling her it can not be traced and to call back the next day. On Saturday, they still could not trace it and assumed it was in Mozambique as well, they tried reaching out to the colleagues in Mozambique but were told to wait till Monday so that they can check in case the bags was with customs.
The bag was located and for some reasons best known to themselves, they sent the bag to Nairobi (VIA MALAWI) and Nairobi had to send it back to Malawi. By then this Tuesday. If the bag fiasco wasn't enough, when the bag arrived, my sister noticed that the bag weighed much less than before. They opened the bag only to find that EVERYTHING that was NEW - Every single Item that was bought on their trip - had been stolen. A couple thousand USD worth of items all stolen. My sister completed a compensation form, so we will wait to see how that goes.

I feel very disappointed and sad for my mother, who went for a critical medical checkup to have undergone such tremendous stress with this airline.
A number of my friends have complained about Kenya Airways - from delayed flights not only for hours but days which ended up with them missing their connecting flights, to rude flight attendants, baggage missing as well as theft of items from customers bags. And one sad thing was that when my sister went to collect the first bag on Saturday, she met a guy who was from Gambia, His luggage also went missing on a Kenya airways flight. He came to Malawi for a one week conference and unfortunately all his stuff were in the missing bag and the only items he had were the clothes he had on that day and a very small hand luggage.

From my mothers experience and what I have heard from friends, I wouldn't recommend Kenya airways to my worst enemy. It is a complete mockery to other airlines and very incompetent.

To Kenya Airways, your services are beyond dismal and disgraceful! You should run a matatu bus service, not an international airline.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeahBen1,Leah Ben wrote a review Mar 2017,Leah Ben,"Lilongwe, Malawi",8 contributions,20 helpful votes,Mumbai - Lilongwe,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r463655096-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Terribly Worst Airline to Ever Exist on earth,Date of travel: February 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The onward flight to Kigali was with a smaller plan and I was surprised that we had a full meal during the just over 1hr flight.

"I flew on 14th February and my daughter's luggage was not found when we arrived. I had to take her shopping for new clothes for her to be able to change after the long flight from Nigeria to South Africa. I arrived alone today 22nd February without my own luggage. How does an airline that calls themselves ""the pride of Africa"" not take care of passengers luggage and deliver them on arrival? I'm very disappointed! The Kenya airways workers insist that I must show up at the airport physically to be able to collect my luggage. It's going to cost me a lot in fuel and time wasted to go all the way to Lagos airport from where I live.

"As previously stated  I have a bad leg and spinal problem  so am limited to  what I can do Seating on any aircraft is difficult  to begin with being 6 feet+ and well built. Airlines do seem to charge more for  bulkhead seats  and I don't understand the logic   Yes there is more legroom (minimal) but the seat itself is  less well equipped with  tv monitor etc and closeness to the toilets for some is disruptive. Kenya airways  allowed me the seat at no extra charge therefore   catering to my disability a lot of airlines ignore the disabled or discourage them from flying economy.It was a ""Dream liner""  sadly I am not a fan of this aircraft as it has most uncomfortable seats with a head rest to low for anyone over 5'6'' and  hard cushioningThe meal was  served hot  and  the new portion size was totally adequate and the food itself  was unusual for an in flight meal  well prepared and tasty They finally got the coffee right as well  hot  and not too bitter.

"I would like to share what happened to my children today at Harare Airport KENYA AIRWAYS.
My ex husband who lives in Dar Es Salaam booked air tickets for my children to go and visit him in Dar Es Salaam. He did this online where he had to state the childrens names and ages (16 & 13)and the ticket confirmation came through. When the tickets were forwarded to me I sent an email to KENYA AIRWAYS asking if the children could go as unaccompanied minors, and my ex also emailed KENYA AIRWAYS.
We heard nothing back from the airline so when I went to check the kids in today I asked if they could go as unaccompanied minors, I was told to go to their office, which I did I was told that the cost for this is $100.00 per child one way, total there and back $400.00. I said that there was no ways I was paying for that and I am sure my kids will be fine. AT NO POINT DID SHE TELL ME THAT MY KIDS COULD NOT GO ON THE FLIGHT UNLESS THE MONEY WAS PAID.
I went checked the kids in and sent them through Customs once they got through my daughter messaged to say they were seated in the lounge, and I left and came back to work. I then got a panic message from my daughter telling me that they are allowing her on the plane but not her brother as he is a minor and unless the money is paid he cannot go on the flight.
I then spoke to the lady who I had dealt with and she said that she told me to pay but I had said that I wasn’t, which is correct, she never said they cant go on the flight if I don’t pay and surely if we had booked the tickets Kenya airways would had come back to say children aren’t allowed on their own.
Lucky my daughter had money to pay as it was 15 minutes before the flight was leaving that this all started. This has traumatized my children and they were faced to deal with this unprofessional behavior. My children have flown to Dar Es Salaam before on a different airline and there was never an issue like this.

Expecting to get my laggauge upon arrival at Kenneth Kaunda airport- Lusaka, i waited over 30minutes and only after inquiring (receiving very bad service from the gentleman in charge of lagguage services, was i told that my lagguage was put on another airline in Nairobi and would only arrive with at 5pm. I called through at 6pm and was told my laggauge will only be in the next day at 10am. I received my lagguage only to find it was opened, damaged and items stolen even after all the effort/ cost of having it wrapped with cling wrap before departing at Heathrow airport. The airline agreed to only replace my suitcase and after following up with them for 4 weeks, their excuse was that their finance personnel quit work. After a week of continuously following up, I was told that they can only pay out $100 for a suitcase even though the price of the suitcase around the market is minimum $150.

"OK, so I thought I would be clever and pay the lower price and grin and bear it if it was a bad experience. Not a good choice on my part.
Where to start? Well, maybe in Dubai. I have to say that the check in there was about the best part of the whole experience. It was frustrating as the boarding counters only opened 3 hours before expected departure, and by that time there was a large and rather confused gathering of potential passengers, without a Kenya Airways staff member in sight.
Kenya Airways, as with other airlines that have online check-in, will need to establish a better system for dealing with bag-drop customers, as the line and waiting time for bag-drop was longer and moved slower than the standard check-in queue.
The whole process was redeemed by a very efficient and friendly lady on the check-in counters. she smiled at everyone and was incredibly helpful. Kudos to her, she was the best staff member I encountered on the entire return trip.
I guess I should have also known that traveling on a 737 to Nairobi, and then again to Johannesburg was going to be a challenge. The Kenyan Airways 737-800's I flew on are not really adequately equipped for a 5 hour flight
The seats were close together, and not very comfortable. On-board entertainment was adequate, but the headphones are antiquated and require passengers to attempt themselves to put on felt covers, which are not the easiest things to handle. Especially first thing in the morning. My mood wasn't helped by having to get up a few times before we even took off to allow the people seated next to me to move, as they had sat in the wrong seats.
I was also shocked when the cabin announcement came over that we should remain vigilant and keep an eye on our hand luggage as there may be theft on the plane.
The flight itself was OK, with reasonably palatable food. The lady who eventually sat next to me sadly decided to spread herself out too, making my experience even worse.
The changeover at Nairobi was also poorly handled. Jomo Kenyatta airport can have all the upgrades it likes, but the ground staff's incompetence is not dealt with they can expect worse reviews. The initial departure gate was changed, and the announcement over the PA was unintelligible, The television displays were also not changed to show the new gate. it turned out that the PA announcement was also wrong. Eventually we all got on board though.
The flight to Johannesburg was equally uncomfortable, made even worse by the most awful meal I think I have ever been served on an international flight. The beef was one large blob of gristle. Yuk. The flying itself was smooth, I can give some credit to the pilots.
The return trip on 7th January was better only by virtue of it being on a brand spanking new 787. I arrived at check in early, and I was glad that I did. I am still not sure that I understand what happened. I had one suitcase weighing 27kg, and a hand luggage bag of approximately 8kg. The luggage allowance for economy class passengers is two bags of 23kg. For business class it is 2 bags of 32Kg.
I had one bag, but because it weighed 27Kg, I was asked to empty out 4Kg into my hand luggage. If I could only have one suitcase at 23Kg then I understand. I was 19Kg under my total weight limit, and the 27Kg suitcase was not a handling issue, as Kenya Airways accepts 32Kg cases from business class customers. Please be warned future economy class flyers. The big thing for me was not even having to unpack and repack, but the joy that it seemed to bring to the ground staff who were instructing me.
So to Nairobi, where once again I witnessed a display of incompetence so obvious it was painful. Firstly we were delayed in leaving by over an hour. passengers were asked to go to the departure lounge as if the flight was on time. This lounge started filling up. No announcements were made at all informing us of the reason for the delay or that there was a delay. this is very poor. Then the coup de grace. The ground staff member who is now responsible for allowing passengers on to the flight (bearing in mind that all passengers had been screened at the door to the lounge) decides in his infinite wisdom to open the doors to the airbridge.
Passengers then got up and formed a crush at the open door, where they were then told through a raised and panicked voice that the plane was boarding by zone and that everyone should remain seated. That was not going to happen. It was bizarre to see business class passengers and families squeezing through an irritated crowd. Surely that was not the first time the ground staff member had boarded passengers onto a plane?
My advice - if you are going to Kenya and there is no other choice, use Kenya Airways. Otherwise steer well clear.

"Travelled from Heathrow to Nairobi and Nairobi to Zanzibar.

On arrival at Heathrow all was good until I got to the departure gate people were complaining that couples did not have seats together. I asked to change my seat as have a bad shoulder and was told no without even looking. Other people who went to ask after me had their seats changed. I was sat in a middle seat and was almost set upon to change my seat by a woman who wanted to sit with her husband for the 8 1/2 hour flight. The entertainment was so old Casablanca in black and white. Food was very poor and as a night flight attendants were no where to be seen. Breakfast was a croissant (small) and a plain yogurt which was not very nice. On way back I was starving flying out at 3am we ended up leaving at 2am 1 hour earlier with no notice and for the 2 1/2 hour flight from Zanzibar to Nairobi was only given a small croissant and yogurt no water. I then had 5 hours wait at Nairobi which is so confusing finding the gate as they kept changing the gate number. Again food was small and poor I was given two meals which was breakfast of a few potatoes spinach and sausage the bread roll was stale and plain yogurt which was not nice no water. The second meal lunch was beef with noodles which was child size salad small a piece of cake which was tasteless again no water. When asking for water you would only get a small cup. I was starving and asked for snacks which was two small packets of nuts. Upon landing I felt dizzy and have trouble walking as felt faint been to GP and told I was severely dehydrated.

"As Delta members, we wanted to remain loyal to skyteam, but Kenya airways doesn't seem to care about their customers. We arrived in Nairobi on a red-eye from Gaborone for our connection to Abidjan, and it was delayed. Ok, no problem. We finally go to board, and we are told that we don't have seats now, because they had to change planes, and we were supposed to magically know this (no announcements made) and go see the desk to get new seats.

We go to the desk and are not given any information, pushed around, then told that they are re-routing us as our flight is boarding. They tell us that we have to stay in Nairobi overnight, then fly out in the morning. Well, we aren't allowed to be in Nairobi, so that doesn't work. Then after much insisting, they come up with a solution. We are told to fly to Addis Ababa, find the Kenya Airways desk, and they will put us up in a hotel overnight so we can get a flight home in the morning (there's a groups of 8 of us by the way). Well, we get to Addis, and are given the run around for hours. No Kenya airways desk, no hotel, no sympathy from the Ethiopian Airlines staff.

"I still remember that day I actually left the hotel 2.5 hours before the flight. Suffering from traffic problem when I arrived the airport, only about 1 hour left. However, the service counter was closed and the staff told me I could not check in my baggage and I have to reschedule my flight. One of staff claim that we can still get on the flight without baggage and asked me to find the Kenya Airways service counter. When I arrived the counter, the staff told me I can no longer get on the flight even without baggage. I was shocked and confused by what the staff told me. The flight would take off at 1510 and I was there in the service counter at 1425, I totally have enough time to reach the flight while they refused to help. This is totally unreasonable for me.

To avoid trouble and more payment, I couldn't but to ask for a rearrangement of flight while the flight could only be as soon as 2 days later. I was thankful that Ms UNGSUMALYN from Kenya Airway kindly helping me with the payment and reschedule.

However, I was totally disappointed when the other day I was taking KQ860 back to HK, the flight finish boarding at 1500. Comparing to my previous arriving time of about 1 hour, they totally could have given me a hand with that but they refuse to give a hand. Due to tight schedule, one of my friend need to buy another flight ticket, and the other friend and I were stuck there in Bangkok and rushing to find hotel to overcome that two days.
Before taking Kenya Airways, I was really expecting that. After this experience, I could say this is an once in a life time experience.

"Slightly apprehensive we boarded this Boeing 737 from Mumbai to Nairobi on way to our sojourn at Masai Mara. An early morning flight, we upgraded our economy bookings into empty business class seats at a cheap option and never regretted the choice. With ample leg space and ample reclining seats (not 180 degrees flat bed mind you - as this a narrow body boeing aircraft), our journey was made more than comfortable by the steward who took utmost care of all of us throughout the trip. Hot breakfast was served when we wanted it. The flight smooth and on time.

On the way home we flew from Bangkok to Nairobi but we only recieved one boarding pass, the staff promised it's all fine we will recieve the other boarding pass for our flight from Nairobi to JHB when we land in Kenya. Once we landed we went to the desk to get our boarding pass however they did not have it as they overbooked the flight, even though I booked these flights months in advanced and did the online check in 24 hours before.

Due to a problem with delayed luggage for a flight 3 days prior to our flight there was a lot of problems just checking in. A number of passengers from a flight 3 days prior were protesting not getting their luggage - this protest lasted most of the day and delayed our boarding for almost 8 hours which meant most of us missed our connecting flights.

"The plane from Dubai to Nairobi is the new Dreamliner.  The seats in business class are very spacious, they can be converted into a completely flat bed.  The cabin crew are great, very friendly and polite, dare I say even better than the gulf carriers.  As long as you are on a Dreamliner or Embraer your flight should be ok, but beware of the dreaded Boeing 737-800s. Those boeing planes are not the best. there are no individual screens in both business and economy and the air conditioning is also faulty.

"I booked my ticket months in advance through Delta, traveling den-Amsterdam-Nrb then the return NRB-PARIS-UTAH-DEN.
I arrived at theJKIA airport 3 hrs before departure time. At check in the lady told me your flight to Paris has been cancelled and no reason why. I told her I needed her to put me on another flight, she said No. asked if they would put me up at a hotel and she said they don't do that. I asked to speak to a manger, it took 2hrs for to come and say there is nothing they can do. I spent the night at the airport. The flight eventually left at 6am in the morning. Due to this I missed my connecting flight to Utah.
While in Paris I could not find any KQ staff to assist me with rebooking. Air France was no help either I had to call my wife back in the States to have me rebooked.
I arrived in Paris at 11:30am and between 7 different customers service lines and 4 back and forth shuttle rides between the terminals nothing got resolved. I was hungry and tired.
My wife got me rebooked for a flight leaving 8:45am the next day. But I still had to still find a place to rest. The sky team in Paris was able to get a hold of KQ rep who only gave me a food voucher of $16 and drink $5. No where to sleep so another night at the airport.
Am sorry to say that KQ should not be in the airline business if the cannot treat there customers well. The rudeness, and lack of empathy from them was appalling to say the least.
Delta, KLM and Air France need to cut there partnership with KQ if they want to keep there customers.

Business class seats looked terrible, cloth not properly put back. Decline of seat not working. TV system only has very old movies.

KQ, in true African spirit, probably bought their ""best African airline of the year"" award, 4 years in a row.

"Kenya Airways (KQ) used to be up there but they are dropping their wits very quickly. Every week newspaper articles and reports come out here in Kenya, saying they are pretty much bankrupt, pilots are striking, ground crew that don't show up to work and corruption allegations.

Some examples of my latest experience with Kenya Airways:
- flying from RSA to Kenya, we were on the 6pm flight on a Saturday. When we got to the terminal, a lot of tired-looking people and angry faces were there already. KQ had decided to cancel the morning and midday flights and push everyone onto the evening flight.
- flying to and from Zanzibar, we got the chance to upgrade our tickets to business class at an extra cost. We thought it would be worth it. First it took about 5 calls to the call centre in order to finally get our new e-ticket, then there was an issue with the ticket of our baby not being included and on the way back, it took the KQ representative until an hour before take-off to show up and sort out our seats as there was ""a problem with sequencing""

I did have some good experience with KQ in cooperation with KLM, flying to Amsterdam. But if I can avoid it, I will not book any more flights with them.

Another tip: don't buy the cheapest ticket, buy the 2nd cheapest at the minimum (regular economy). Otherwise they put you on a waiting list and you won't be sure of a seat on the flight of your choice.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Swinkey9,Angela S wrote a review Dec 2016,Angela S,"Galu Beach, Kenya",29 contributions,12 helpful votes,Nairobi - Zanzibar Island,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r445032857-Kenya_Airways-World.html,The Shame of Africa,Date of travel: December 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We took kenya airways to fly to zanzibar from johannesburg. At O R Thambo, the staff who worked at the check in desks of Kenya Airways were rude, unfriendly and entirely not reflective of the 'pride of 'Africa'. They should be embarrassed by their attitudes. Nevertheless we boarded the plane, landed in Nairobi for our transit to zanzibar.

The airport was not good. Our connecting flight details were not posted on the screen and no one could guide us where to go. Eventually someone told us to walk towards the correct gate. Once we got there, I encountered a kenya airways staff member by the name of Maureen who was absolutely and shockingly appalling at her service. (She worked at the precision air check in desk on the 06 Dec at about 08:00am) She honestly was the rudest and most unfriendly person- she would barely even answer the questions people asked her appropriately and could not be bothered at all. If she doesn't want to work there then please employ someone who does.. someone who will do a better job.

On the way back from zanzibar, the flight services and air hostesses and check in staff were much much nicer. We came back to johannesburg on a new plane (just over a year old). It was clean and lovely, and the staff were accommodating. Was very impressed with Kenya Airways on the way back to johannesburg.

"Departure for my route from Dubai to Nairobi was already 2h late and due to that I missed my connection flight to Johannesburg. I arrived Nairobi 1pm and was then booked for 9pm flight to Johannesburg (with Kenya Airways).

I was put in a lousy bus to be transported to city center into Meridian hotel, that was relatively far away. Hotel itself was ok for few hours rest before bus came to pick up and transfer back to airport for my last leg.

Bus was full of other passengers also missed their connection flights and all the hand baggage was put into the front of the bus.
At the security gate just before the airport, all passengers were asked to exit the bus and walk through security check screening. I asked few times from the driver what about the hand baggage and he kept repeating we should not take them to save time and they are all safe inside bus.
I had my wallet inside my laptop bag and $600 cash. When I reached airport and was about to pay sandwich with USDs, I noticed all USD 600 were gone. I did not left my wallet and laptop bag out of my eyes anywhere else than those ~5min inside the bus.

It took me 15 hours to get from Johannesburg to Nairobi with Kenya Airways . This airline is the epitome of ineptitude. If you can imagine the Three Stooges running an airline then Kenya Airways is it. The food in BC is what you would get in a public hospital. The staff are only interested in helping african passengers. I should have used South African Airways.

"I am a very regular traveler on Kenya Airways and i am generally very satisfied with their service although i must sadly say most of the time they never depart on time on any of the 6 routes that i regularly fly on (Half of these are international). Having said all that i must add they are one of my preferred airlines, however i must rate the airline very poorly when it comes to the Nairobi to Accra and return trips. This is a route that i regularly travel and it is not one that i look forward to. As a rule Kenyan Airways staff are very courteous, polite and very helpful. Unfortunately i must say that in the last few months i have encountered some very rude and unhelpful staff on this route (both ways). It is quite a long (5 hour) trip and not the most enjoyable since Kenya Airways use probably their oldest 737's on this specific route which do not offer nice comfortable seating as in other models and there are no personal screens to watch your own choice in movies so you cannot sleep due to uncomfortable seating and you cannot watch a movie to get the time by. The onboard staff on these trips did not help in making it easier. I have personally experienced and have also witnessed other travelers experience some rude behavior when requesting something to drink or other assistance during the flight. Once the meals are served and everything cleared they rush to enclose themselves behind their curtains and if anyone requests some assistance  after this it is as if they are doing everyone a huge favor by assisting and not the type of behavior we were expecting from professional staff. On other (Shorter) routes they will always come at regular intervals with water and juice and will always be at hand to assist with a smile. I don't understand what is different on this route but it is not a pleasant experience.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/5b/d8/c0/koosb.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Koosb,Koosb wrote a review Dec 2016,Koosb,"Karen, Kenya",80 contributions,22 helpful votes,Accra - Nairobi,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r442082552-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Nairobi to Accra return trip,Date of travel: November 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I risked this route based on a past fond memory of Kenya Airways(KQ).
I was traveling for a conference with tight turnarounds between that and my next trip. I selected this route based on the listed times from the airline about the route.

The first day, the flight was cancelled after we had been kept waiting 2.5 hours after expected departure time. Reportedly due to technical issues. We were told to return the next day at the same time. I returned the next day and again we were delayed about an hour before the plane finally took off.
On boarding the plane, it was obvious this was not a route that was cared about because the plane was so unkempt and had obvious missing internal pieces, carpet was dirty and so on.
The layover went much more smoothly and the plane from NBO to DXB was brand new... smell a rat yet?
Anyway, I missed one day of the conference due to this ... KQ apologized via a comment I'd made on twitter and I was hopeful for the flight back.

Early morning flight out of DXB was again delayed... Pilot said they had been late so missed departure window. Well, that meant again I missed connection in NBO. The only option was to wait till 6.25pm for another flight... this was at 7:50 in the morning. I was offered a hotel in town which I declined.

I insisted on getting out earlier and a staff member promised to book me on a different airline after first telling me that my class of ticket was not eligible for re-booking on other airlines!

I was given false hope however, as there was a staff switch and apparently someone didn't get an email they were supposed to have.
I ended up spending the entire day at the airport. The staff member on Twitter had the nerve to tell me that delays happen for the ""safety"" of their passengers which might have been okay if we didn't already know that the delays were not safety related, but also not what to say to an already frustrated customer.

The entire day in the lounge, flights were announced as delayed for various routes. One lady missed her Godson's wedding, and so on.

The only folks that exhibited some remorse and actually tried to help were the front desk personnel at the lounge... one lady named Florence and some guy named Derrick who even if they were lying, went about seemingly caring for customers.

To top it off, they had a prompt for customers to take a survey recommending them as best airline for 2016! Talk about being blind to self!

I would rather take a connecting flight with a more reliable airline than fly with Kenya Airways again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tjsmart,tjsmart wrote a review Nov 2016,tjsmart,"Mountain View, California",106 contributions,57 helpful votes,Lagos - Dubai,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r439864557-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Equipment discrimination on routes plus consistently late departures,Date of travel: November 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"We just had a  month in east africa, we traveled to many countries, all with Kenya air, Not 1 trip went according t schedule, they were cancelled, delayed, added extra destination, waited 1 hr on tarmac waiting for lost baggage from connecting flights.  Some flights changed 4 times since booking. You turn up at airport for a 3.20 flight, to be told it has been cancelled til 1am in the morning. they load you and 30 other disgruntled passengers onto a bus with all luggage, take you to a hotel for 5 hrs, you dont sleep as it is afternoon. load you back on the bus to go back to the airport, and they have dismissed all but one staff check-in lady, who has to process 30+ people for the flight. then you have another destination to Hararre, Zimbabwe, to go to where you sit on the tarmac for 45min while some get off and some get on, then off to Nairobi, where you have to wait 2 hrs till connecting flight is ready, which takes you to somewhere else before you get to Dar es Salam. and this is/ was with EVERY flight we had with Kenya Air, Never Again will i travel with them.

"Delayed leaving from EBB by over an hour. Absolutely no communication from ground staff or plane staff. No apology from captain.

We had a connecting flight, also with Kenya Airways. We asked repeatedly if the flight would wait or if there was an alternative if we missed the connection. Again, communication was confused and incorrect. The staff did not take responsibility for their mess.

We were told we would be met by staff at transfers. No one there. We ran to the gates to see if we could make it. The flight had left. We eventually found the desk. More misinformation, but the staff did book us the next flight and a hotel for the few hours we needed to wait.

Such an arduous process, one desk after another. We finally get through and get our voucher. Bus takes ages to get to hotel (they choose the Weston, which is over half an hour away).

Bad service continues as bus takes ages to leave hotel when we are due to depart.

"Flights

All were on time, no delays and arrived on time. For that, cannot complain at all.

Planes

Dreamliner - good in-flight entertainment, films, games, audio.
Seats - very cramped although I am 6ft. I was surprised as I thought there would be more room in the cabin as the width is wide. Seat formation was 3 - 4 - 3. If sitting in the middle with an end seat plenty of bumping by people passing. Just felt very tight.

190 - although seat formation was 2-2 there appeared more room and space and felt more airy! Leather seats and personal in-flight entertainment screen.

Luggage

Allow you 23kg suitcase x2 which is a bonus.

Crew

Presentable and professional - maybe could smile a little more! Maybe being picky.

Food

Dreamliner - good, hot meals ranged from fish, beef and chicken tasted fine with good flavours. Cannot complain & it's plane food and not restaurant style after all.
Drinks available, and water when asked although provided in small plastic cup - one sip and all gone.
Appreciate costs although providing a bottle of water would be better.
Heathrow to Nairobi flight left at 17.55. Meal in the evening then early breakfast.
Nairobi to Heathrow left at 09.25.
Meal breakfast then lunch.

190 - small snack I.e. tea/coffee and croissant. Fine for journey between 45mins to 1 hr. Nairobi to Mombasa.

Overall both flights on time, service good, only little grumble is the feeling of being cramped and seats uncomfortable on dreamliner ( and I am not really one to moan if a chair is uncomfortable).

Would travel again with kenya airways. √

Not sure why most people down grade the in flight entertainment on the dreamliner. Personal screens with films, music, games, maybe they want dancing girls and a choir.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f0/d5/default-avatar-2020-17.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mmm_72_70,Mmm_72_70 wrote a review Nov 2016,Mmm_72_70,"Horsham, United Kingdom",51 contributions,18 helpful votes,London - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r438679403-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Happy with service - Would fly again with the airline ,Date of travel: November 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"They pride themselves with 'Pride of Africa'...erm, not so much to be proud about unfortunately. Not only did we find most ground staff unfriendly and not being very helpful, it continued on the plane as well. Our flight was over an hour delayed (although it was displayed with 25min only)  which made us worry if we would catch the connecting flight from Nairobi to Bkk. We already asked at check in where we've been told 'you will make it, don't worry' - ok! As the flight departure got later and later, we asked the flight attendant again on board to hear that only the captain would get information about the connecting flight before landing... Still we didn't hear any updates. After asking again, as we just were about to land 20 min before departure time of our  next flight, we looked into an annoyed face of our stewardess. Okayyy... We entered Nairobi Airport, running to our gate amongst other passengers who tried to catch the flight after not getting any replies from any staff we asked, we see the gate is closed, to see our flight departing without us 10min later. From inside the airport! They made us wait for the first flight and then can't manage within their own company to make a machine wait for 15 more minutes?! The worst let down was how the situation was handled after by the ignorant, unfriendly and clueless staff. Around 50 angry passengers were waiting for hours without proper info what would happen now. We've been rescheduled to a flight 24 hours later!! Without our luggage we've been brought to a hotel which actually sucked too as nothing there was in working order.

"Had a flight with Ethiopian airlines to Addis Ababa, and from there to Nairobi. I had my luggage on Ethiopian and from there I needed it to be transferred to Kenya airways, simple? Not in with those companies...
It was impossible to locate Kenya airways counter in the airport of Addis Ababa because they don't have one... When I finally met them on the terminal (not in an office or something, just on the way somewhere), they told me everything is okay and that I should come only 1.5 hour before my flight and they know it's weird but this how it works. When I got to the counter 1.5 before boarding Kenya Airways staff member ASSURED me that my bag is on the plane, so I was relieved... but when I was boarding they told me my bag wasn't found!
When I was in Nairobi no one called to inform me when to expect for the luggage, I needed to do the calling, all the time! On top of everything, I wasn't reimbursed in anything because somehow the bag arrived 22 hours later, 2 hours short... so I had a pretty bad experience with them.

"I arrived early as is recommended when flying out of Lagos. As the time for the flight approached there was no boarding info. The time for the flight came and went and still no information. Not one representative from Kenya Airways was to be found. Slowly all outlets closed and still no word. I called KLM in Amsterdam to find out what was happening and was told the flight was cancelled and that I was booked on a flight the next morning with a connection (via Nairobi) to Johannesburg. No hotel was offered and people were sleeping on the stone floor in front of the gate. Families with children etc. Morning came and I still hadn't seen anyone from Kenya Airways and there was no announcement or boarding call. Again I called KLM in Amsterdam (partner airline and I am gold member with them), I was told the flight was delayed by three hours. I now kind of knew that I would miss my connecting flight in Nairobi. When I finally boarded the flight it was packed and I was squeezed between two very large women (not their fault and I didn't complain but suffered in silence). Sure enough, I had missed the flight to Johannesburg and was offered a hotel for the night. Except I had no visa for Kenya and had to line up to get one through KQ, which took over and hour and a half. I then had to exit the airside part of the airport through passport control which took another hour and a half. After that, I had to line up to get the hotel voucher, which took another hour. I then had to sit on a bus for an hour to wait for the other passengers who were in the same boat. When I finally arrived at the hotel it was 2am in the morning and the hotel pickup was at 4am, so I basically got one hour of sleep. Thankfully the last flight was on time and I got a nice aisle seat. I didn't eat any of the food because I know it is terrible from previous flights with Kenya airways and I arrived in Johannesburg more than 36 hours late with no apology for KQ. The flight attendants were indifferent and not about to take ownership of anything. I travel for work and will do everything I can to avoid KQ in the future.

"First time with Kenya and hopefully not the last. Check in quick and easy. Staff polite and helpful and immaculate. Food good and plenty of complimentary drinks. Food choice a bit small but quality good for airline food. Plenty of films etc on in flight entertainment on 747 to Nairobi but a bit lacking on Embrauer 190 (I think) from Nairobi to Livingstone.

"Very quick check-in. Option of checking on-line available. There is help with check-in by attendants at the airport.

The staff are very kind, polite and professional. They also look good in their well tailored and proper fitting uniforms.

Though there could be more leg space to allow for seatmates to pass as they need to use the bathroom, the space to stretch your legs is adequate (and I should know since I am 5'8 with more leg length than torso).

The food is good and there is a wide variety of drinks to choose from. There could however be more variety on the menu e.g two vegetarian options and two non-vegetarian options.

the cabins are clean and passengers are well taken care of e.b supply of blankets, earphones etc.

Most of all this particular ride was very smooth, with steady take-off and landing.

He ensured I got my choice of food. But I seriously think they should start service from both sides rather than from seat number 12 of economy class. First of all the back rows get the food an hour plus after the first rows get the food and secondly there is no choice of drink and food as it is already consumed by the first and middle rows!!! The journey from mumbai to Nairobi, the flight is in the late afternoon and was delayed by more than an hour!! Here is where the staff should use their experience and be very emphatic to customer requirement. Basic request of drinking water is curtly denied till take off.

"Kenya Airways was the worst flying nightmare that came true for us! We had such a wonderful time on our trip in Africa, and Kenya Airways almost ruined it. When they cancelled our flight out of Tanzania, which made us miss our next two connecting flights to South Africa, we knew it’s going to be a long night. What should have been a 9-hour journey from Kilimanjaro to Cape Town turned into 29 miserable, stressful hours of not knowing if we would ever make it to our next destination.

When it’s time for the next flight to come, I almost missed the plane because they didn’t rebook my ticket. Then we missed our flight from Cape Town from Johannesburg because they didn’t rebook our connecting tickets properly either, so we ended up bumming around a sketchy terminal from midnight until 9am until their office was open to resolve the issue.

Cherry on top – they lost my luggage along the way, which put a huge damper on the rest of our trip.

This was our first time flying with Kenya Airways, and it will be our last. Do yourself a favor and fly with other airlines if you can (like British Airways or South African Airways)",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/13/c4/58/c2/sofia-p.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/601sofiap,Sofia P wrote a review Nov 2016,Sofia P,"San Francisco, California",81 contributions,58 helpful votes,Kilimanjaro National Park - Cape Town Central,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r435501977-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Kenya Airways ruined our Africa trip!,Date of travel: October 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I was rerouted on this Kenya Airways flight because of a problem with KLM on my originally planned trip.  The service was excellent with cheerful and upbeat flight attendants and above average food.  Unfortunately Kenya Airways is following the practice of many other airlines, they are putting 9 seats across in a plane designed for 8 across, the B787 Dreamliner.  It's a nice aircraft with interesting new features, but what good are bigger windows and fancy electronic dimmers if you feel terribly crammed in with constant shoulder contact with your neighbour because of the too narrow seats?

"The SkyPriority Lounge is Nairobi is lovely first of all - that's was about it.  We flew on a 787 (can't possible be that old) from NBO - AMS and the plane interior looks dingy and in need of some cleaning.  The seats in economy were awfully uncomfortable - narrower than on KLMs new 787 fleet and much less leg room.My main issue and reason for reporting was the quality of service during the flight.  The flight attendant came through the cabin twice offering drinks only with the meals (which were inedible).  Most airlines offer bottles of water - this airline gives these cheap 200ml cups of water.  There were also no snacks offered between the meal services on the flight.  When I went to the galley to ask  for more water, a few flight attendants were literally sleeping with their shoes off and acted offended that I would ask them for something during their snooze.It was a fluke that we ended up taking Kenya Airways back to Amsterdam, but we will never make that mistake again.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shawn_wellington,Shawn C wrote a review Oct 2016,Shawn C,"Wellington, New Zealand",818 contributions,116 helpful votes,Nairobi - Amsterdam,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r430316638-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Really should have waited for the KLM flight...,Date of travel: October 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I fly KQ very regularly, almost weekly throughout Africa - approx 40-50 flights yearly.

Despite the crew providing the best service they can, it is evident KQ are struggling to live up to their tagline: Pride of Africa. The food is disappointing, the condition of some of the planes is not at the standard it should be. Delays are becoming more frequent.

Of absolute greatest concern is whether the maintenance of the aircraft is at the level it should be. There are too many rumours of poor servicing, maintenance staff being poached by Middle Eastern airlines, cash flow problems and planes stranded (witnessed a brand new KQ Dreamliner stuck in Hanoi, Vietnam for 3 days last month due to parts - brand new!).

Took 4 flights in October with Kenya airlines. i found the staff very friendly and efficient and the planes excepting for the last leg of the trip very good. Unfortunately on the last leg it was on a very old plane with narrow seats and not much room. The media was shared and the movie shown was boring. The meals are good but do not cater for a diabetic as meal would have a starch and meat/chicken/fish plus a potato salad and a pudding and a white bread roll. No sugar free drinks available on the plane either. No pre selection of meals on booking and the web site did not allow us to check in from the Seychelles at all.

"I was flying from Abidjan to Nairobi in business class recently. Getting through the check in process was quick and easy - the guy at the business counter was friendly and efficient. He effortlessly changed my seat from the 1st row to the second to give me some more legroom. The ensuing chaos to navigate through passport and security control can not be blamed on Kenya Airways. At least I could recover with gin and tonic in the lounge which was bright, clean and relatively quiet.

This flight itself, however did not get off to a good start. Boarding was a disaster. Vague attempts were made to call business class passengers earlier than the rest but this was totally chaotic and meant that I was one of the last to board in the business area and there appeared to be absolutely no space left for my hand luggage. I just dumped it in front of me and waited for the cabin staff to arrange something for me which they did.

This was an overnight flight and the business class seats, whilst being bigger than in economy, only reclined a little - a joke for such a long, 6 hour flight when a chance to sleep should be expected.

At least we were offered a variety of drinks before take off. I certainly needed a glass of champagne.

Pretty soon into the flight I got my pre-ordered gin and tonic just a few minutes ahead of my meal - an ""exotic"" salad presumably so named because there were some pineapple pieces added for good measure. I chose a main course comprising beef strips, rice, carrots and spinach. This was quite spicy. The accompanying Shiraz red wine from an indeterminate country was OK.

Entertainment on this long flight comprised a film on the small screens emerging from the bulkhead which was laughable. I gave up and listened to my music on my smartphone.

Most of the rest of the flight was in pure darkness. I tried sleeping but it was impossible with the seats provided. I was so grateful that the pilot was able to catch up on a late take off.

Sorry to be so negative but the tickets for business class are not cheap. And other airlines have understood how to make such journeys much more comfortable. The one saving grace was the patience and constant smile on the lips of the cabin crew.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/03/47/ea/eyekaytoo.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eyekaytoo,Eyekaytoo wrote a review Oct 2016,Eyekaytoo,"Leverkusen, Germany",2437 contributions,701 helpful votes,Abidjan - Nairobi,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r428484731-Kenya_Airways-World.html,"Full, uncomfortable overnight flight - the cabin crew did their best...",Date of travel: October 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I used Kenyan Airlines this August to go and back to Tanzania, and although the flights were on time, on my way back I checked in my luggage in Zanzibar, I was going through Nairobi and Amsterdam, and when I arrived in Madrid, my sleeping bag was missing from my rocksac. i made a complain about it, and the response has been very very poor and disappointing, no-one has contacting me about it, and I keep calling their customer service and the response is we are looking into it.

I was led to believe this would be spacious and comfortable.   Maybe I was naive.

Cabin crew see. To think they are there to look superior & walk up & down plane. Very rude to several passengers nearby and very unhelpful generally. The food on the flights was awful - you had a choice but standard was early 80s of dried up nuked stiodge!

"I have now decided to pay the extra money to travel with BA to Nairobi than to use KLM as it seems they don't fly anymore to Nairobi, The flight from Edinburgh to Amsterdam is flown by KLM, then from Amsterdam to Nairobi it is KA who in my personal opinion are possibly the worst airline in Africa. Their cabin crews are the worst ever, blunt, never smiling and unwelcoming, unless of course you travel BC which I have done as well with them and still my opinion won't change. Why is it that the airlines in any country in this world are the most expensive to get out of the country you are resident in and KA are one of them, SAA another and only to add BA into the mix. KA are almost on the bones of their backside and I know why as well, because their staff are the most un-cooperative of any airline I have flown with. The return flight from Nairobi to Amsterdam was freezing and when I asked one of the trolley dollies (if you can call them that) for an extra blanket she said ""I'll look but I don't think we have any extra. Meanwhile not five minutes previously I had see the same stewardess open the baggage compartment in BC only to have about six of the blankets fall out as she opened the compartment. She then came and dropped a what seemed used blanket in my lap without a word. Their food on the flight was inedible apart from a small yoghurt, the main meal smelt revolting and a piece of dry sponge did not appeal to me either. I will not use them unless it is absolutely necessary, which it is from Mombasa to Nairobi but that's only for and hour or so. They're always late at take off but the majority of airlines are too yet they keep you sitting for an age before they get the call to take off.

"This was an overnight flight and I had real trouble sleeping 'cos I couldn't get comfortable. Not sure if that's the airline's fault or the plane.
Entertainment was extremely limited. Not a large choice of films or TV. I had flown the route out the fortnight before and the choices were the same. Therefore viewed the films/TV that interested me and still had hours to spare.
The real downside to this airline is the quality (or lack of) of the food.
The sausage on the breakfast tray was identifiable by sight but not taste - had to spit it out. I'm guessing the roll of yellow stuff next to it was some kind of egg but I couldn't tell by the taste nor texture. A small sample was enough for me. You could tell that the overnight dinner was chicken so dipped my bread roll in it which was about the limit you'd want to do.

"The Hong Kong to Nairobi route stops in Bangkok for a bit before continuing on and you have to stay on the plane. Some people find this annoying but it was fine with me. The IFE didn't work on the first leg but the problem was handled well by the flight crew who acknowledged the problem with an announcement and attempted to reboot the system to no avail. Fortunately it was finally up and running again on the flight to Nairobi.

The service on the 787-8 was adequate and the food ordinary, but the IFE was fully loaded with movies.

Overall all I'd say it was worth it for the price and I wouldn't hesitate to fly with them again (if the price is right). I also wouldn't go out of my way to fly with them, hence the 3 star rating.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bretado,bretado wrote a review Sep 2016,bretado,"Nishinomiya, Japan",3 contributions,1 helpful vote,Hong Kong - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r421696950-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Gets the Job Done,Date of travel: August 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I booked on Kenya Airways from Luanda ( Angola ) to Mumbai ( India ) Via Nairobi, as it was the quickest connection.
I am a vegetarian but the website does not have a specific option to select meals, hence I used a general feedback option and it did work.
On the date of flight, I got an email from them, saying that the flight was delayed. I knew that I was going to miss my connection. The airport staff was very supportive and made sure that, my transit accommodation and onward connection is confirmed.
The flight from Luanda to Nairobi was good experience. The ordered meals were served.
At Nairobi airport, arrangement of transit visa was done quickly. The hotel counter took a little long.
But the hotel was good.
The new terminal of Nairobi has started recently. There are very few shops.
The flight from Nairobi to Mumbai was bit delayed. The actual flight was horrible due to the disoriented cabin crew. They took too much time for meals service. The hot beverage service was stopped for no reason. The crew was not attending to calls at all.
One of the guest needed water urgently and he had to argue for it.
After the meals the crew disappeared behind curtains. I wanted to buy some gifts on duty free ( which had some exclusive items ) but the crew never offered it. They never came for the sale. They did not attend any calls.
They did not even collect blankets and headphones back. Did not bother to prepare the cabin for landing. Did not even greet guests at the time of leaving the aircraft at Mumbai.

It appeared to me that they were on strike.

"While already in Africa, some friends and I decided to take a short trip to Zanzibar over an extended weekend for about four days. Unfortunately, more than 1/3 of our trip ended up being spent in transit. I am thoroughly disappointed by the lack of professionalism and competence repeatedly displayed by the Kenya Airway agents in the Nairobi airport. Not only did they ruin a large portion of our vacation and cost us money, but from a business standpoint their inability to manage situations is proving costly to Kenya Airlines as well. I love flying with Skyteam and all their affiliates, specifically Delta and Air France, but my experience with Kenya Airlines has been a disappointment and does not meet the expected standards. We began our experience with Kenya Airways waiting on our flight to Zanzibar where we were to arrive at 8:10 am. There were five of us and together we were paying more than $1000 a night for an all-inclusive resort in Nungwi. The first flight to Nairobi was more than an hour late. I regret not checking Kenya Airlines performance rating for this flight prior to booking since it shows they have a ""poor - 1 out of 5 stars"" rating and are only on time 62% of the time. When we arrived in Nairobi we immediately went to the Kenyan Airlines counter, knowing we had missed our connection. The attendant at the counter told us there were not any other flights that would get us into Zanzibar that day and the only one available left close to midnight and we would arrive the next morning. We had asked if there were any other airlines they could check and put us on since we were able to find a few online. They continued to tell us no, they could not put us on any other airlines and there was nothing available with them. This was a lie and quite frankly, the people at the desk were not even looking for other options. They were content with simply doing the minimal amount of work, checking their cell phones while we were talking, and getting us away from their desk as their attitudes conveyed that we were annoying them simply by being inquisitive. After a bit of back and forth where we were not getting anywhere with the desk attendant we went to breakfast then downstairs to another Kenya Airlines desk. That was where we met Weddy - the most professional and helpful employee we have ever encountered with Kenya Airlines. We explained our predicament and she searched for alternative options, finding a flight leaving that evening with Precision Air (the same airline we had on our return flight that we booked directly through Kenya Airlines) and though we would still spend more than 12 hours in the airport, it would get us into Zanzibar about 11 p.m. Weddy had a long queue lined up and asked us to return in about an hour so she could work on the ticket after she sent some emails and verified the details.
Additionally, Weddy was the only person in the entire airport that understood what a queue was and managed to keep people actually in line and do her job in a proficient manner. The ability to keep people in a queue seemed lost on all your other employees as we would stand in line and random people would forgo the line walking straight up to the desk and the attendants would help them. When we returned later Weddy was able to get us the tickets - we still did not get to our hotel until almost midnight and lost that complete day, our excursion, and our all-inclusive amenities we paid for, but at least Weddy made the attempt to help us fix the issue and was courteous when doing so, unlike your other employees. But that was just the initial flight to Zanzibar - the return flight experience was worst.

When leaving the airport from Zanzibar Sept 4 the personnel at the counter (Precision Air) would not print both our boarding passes, even though we received both our passes on the way in a couple days prior. They told us we had to get them at the desk in Nairobi. We had a 1 hr and 15 min layover and immediately went to the desk to get our tickets. Of course the queue was very long and half the customers ignored the it and walked right up to the desk - which the Kenya Airline employees did not seem to care about and simply helped whomever was in front of them. And by helped I mean again spent the majority of the time talking on their cell phones or texting people in the middle of a customer's complaint/issue. Two of our group attempted to get their passes printed off at the Kiosk but were unable (probably because we were within the 1 hr window) so we all waited. When the first of our group arrived at the desk we still had just over 30 minutes before our flight left. We had already spent 30 minutes in line because of the horrible time management and inefficiency of the staff compounded by their inability to actually keep people in a queue. When we arrived at the desk the gentleman told us we missed our flight. Again, we still had 30 minutes to get to the flight and should have already been checked in when we checked in at the Zanzibar airport. They then told us even if we were first in line at the desk when the plane landed (an hour before takeoff) we still would not have been able to board the plane. Why not? Why would they sell us a ticket on Kenya Airways own website that was a fraud? The entire time we are talking with the desk people they are again, randomly talking to other customers who just walked up (like the outraged lady who was supposed to being going to one location but the Kenya Airways attendants booked her to the wrong country - I didn't really blame her), checking their phones, and essentially being some of the most atrocious customer service representatives imaginable. They were flippant and did not care. Having been at the desk or waiting in the queue for an hour, we were now about to miss the next leg of our vacation stuck in the airport again because of Kenya Airlines. Part of our group was with one attendant at the desk and the others were with the other attendant so they herded us together to one desk ... and promptly ignored us since there were about five other people crowded at the desk also demanding information and assistance. Finally another attendant walked up and told us they will put us in a hotel since they have no other flights until the next afternoon, 17 hours after we had landed, and we should walk to the immigration area and he will be right with us to help us. We go to the immigration area, fill out the paperwork, and wait ... and wait ... and wait. We go back to get him and he said he will be right there, but does not show up again and we wait. The man finally comes and gets us through immigration and now tells us to go downstairs and get a hotel. We find the hotel line and wait some more until Magdalyn at the desk is able to assist us. She was kind and very professional though, not any fault of her own, the hotels available were not in any way, shape or form five stars like we had been told. After booking our stay we were told to go outside to the shuttle. The shuttle is a large older bus and though 90% full when we arrived, we had to wait there until every single seat was taken which was well over 30 more minutes. Finally they were able to take us to our hotels (different people on the bus were staying at different hotels) and we checked in around 1 am, nearly four hours after we had landed. Our meals were provided and other than the hotel being outdated and loud, was fine for a night, it just seems a waste of money for Kenya Airlines in that this whole situation could have been avoided with a little proficiency in your customer service department, not to mention you had now wasted another complete day of ours. The next morning we got up, went to breakfast and immediately left again for the airport - this time with a private shuttle that was much better. We arrive just after 11 a.m. for a
2:50 p.m. flight. Do you think that flight was on time? Of course not. At 2:20 we are standing at the entrance to the seating area (in Nairobi you have to go through another desk to get to your gates specific seating area) and nobody was there. Thirty minutes later when our flight was supposed to be leaving, there was still not any Kenya Airline attendants to be seen. None of the screens in the airport were updated and our flight was still showing as ""on time"" - which was physically impossible since there was not even an airplane on our ramp. One of the airline attendants finally showed up and said we are delayed for approximately two more hours due to maintenance, but would not let us in the seating area so all the passengers just milled about outside or wandered down the terminal to find other seats. After getting to board, the flight staff was wonderfully fine and we had no issues with them, though none of the televisions in the headrest worked on the flights.

I understand that situations arise when traveling and flexibility is key - but I have an issue when those situations become acceptable norms and your Kenya Airlines staff remain aloof and complacent, further complicating the experience. Of what was supposed to be a relaxing 96 hour trip, 31 ADDITIONAL hours (I did not include the time we expected to spend when we booked our flights) were spent in Nairobi due to an utter failure by Kenya Airlines. Not to mention we lost an entire day of our vacation and all expenses incurred with it.

I sent an email to Kenya Airlines first and they sent me a completely professional and respectful reply back - though quit disparaging by stating ""we sincerely regret the inconveniences caused to you as a result of the one hour delay of your flight from Djibouti to Nairobi."" The one hour delay is NOT what this about.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/5f/61/34/amy-a.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmyLoverOfSun,AmyLoverOfSun wrote a review Sep 2016,AmyLoverOfSun,"Ogden, Utah",432 contributions,129 helpful votes,Djibouti - Zanzibar Island,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r420812396-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Spent 30+ hrs of a 96 hr trip stuck at airport due to inept customer service,Date of travel: September 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"The moment KQ sold their golden landing slot at LHR, I knew something was up and made several inquiries. Seems the overnight flight from Nairobi to Heathrow was so hot that the landing slot was sold to Qatar airlines,
Now KQ forced all those who had booked months in advance to change their return schedule from Nairobi to London and lose a day because the flight now leaves Nairobi at 9AM and arrives at Heathrow at 4PM.

I found the cabin service really gone down. Previously we used to get really good cabin service especially on long haul but now literally an entire aisle in economy is covered by one steward serving ALL meals - this takes ages and by the time they reach the seats at the back of the plane the passengers who were served first have not only finished their meals but fallen asleep.

I was appalled by the poor service. Blankets were not provided to everyone and lack of adequate meal option seem to be a common problem on both outbound and inbound flights.

I have been using KQ for the last 15 years and at one point it had surpassed the standards of BA but now for the first time KQ is taking short cuts - this reflects on its share price sadly.

I really hope the management focus on the quality it provides to its passengers and not just focusing on high air fares,",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/35/b7/8a/travel4love.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travel4love,travel4love wrote a review Sep 2016,travel4love,"Ruislip, United Kingdom",1034 contributions,166 helpful votes,Nairobi - London,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r420520385-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Standards are slipping again...............,Date of travel: September 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"First time with Kenya Airways.
What can I say?
The business class cabin feels very spacious, the seating excellent and the staff on both the Dreamliner and Embraeur were both professional and delightful.
The food wins for me however. Much, much better than BA Business class. We had breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks over the 4 separate flights.
I had a piece of lake fish and I have no idea how they managed to serve this perfectly cooked and as fresh tasting as you could want anywhere.
My wife avoids Gluten - every flight had appropriate alternatives for her with fresh gluten free rolls and desserts. Staff knew which of the meal choices had wheat or not.

My wife avoids Gluten - every flight had appropriate alternatives for her with fresh gluten free rolls and desserts. Staff knew which of the meal choices had wheat or not.
Superb service and will fly Kenya Airways again.
Airport services were also good; from the lounges to the dedicated channel at Nairobi (even through a dedicated security scanner).",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/06/9e/f2/ac/andrew-b.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewb161,Andrew B wrote a review Sep 2016,Andrew B,"Norwich, United Kingdom",857 contributions,23 helpful votes,London - Lilongwe,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r417825619-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Business class is top notch,Date of travel: August 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Worst and terrible are even very soft words to describe Kenya airways operations. I have worst experience while flying with Kenya airways for last 5 flight within Africa. During my travel with them I experienced how bad an airline can be operated. I have experienced flight wheels loosing its pressure due to small puncture it had while landing. I have experienced how Harare airport supervisor of Kenya airways is running away from passengers and keeping them stranded waiting for flight at mid night. I have experienced how special meal request of passenger is not followed by airline staff. I have experienced how rude airline staff can be with its passengers. I have experienced how a problem is handled by airline staff from simple to worst.

On a lighter note if you are traveling by Kenya Airways remember its airline code as KQ means 'Keep Quite' as the there is absolutely no use of making any complaint to ground staff.

In my opinion instead of improving on its operations Kenya airways shall change its logo from 'Pride of Africa' to 'Shame of Africa' at least passengers will be ready for experience.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/47/f5/94/bonnerbonn-germany.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BonnerBonn_Germany,BonnerBonn_Germany wrote a review Sep 2016,BonnerBonn_Germany,"Bonn, Germany",41 contributions,10 helpful votes,Entebbe - Harare,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r416188224-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Kenya airways need to improve its operations,Date of travel: August 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Flights were ok and on-time, but my luggage was mislaid in Nairobi (for the second time) and never found.
Papers documenting the loss were sent according to instructions to Kenya Airways in Nairobi, but the letter never arrived. Eventually, electronic copies were accepted. The offer made for the loss was certainly below expectations, but there was no alternative but to accept it. Problem was now that the settlement would only be done after receiving the original of an acceptance letter. Upon recommendation from Kenya Airways, I sent the letter to their Bangkok office (where I reside), and the office would forward the letter. The letter never reached Nairobi, so now the questions are:
am I ever going to be paid ?
is it bad will or total incompetence ?

"KQ is the best airline in Africa without doubt but they need to improve a lot. Firstly their flights en route to Mumbai are quite horrible whereas at one time they used to be really good. Maybe because they sold their dreamliners and kept only those that go to Europe.Food options are not that good and sometimes the flights are more expensive that Emirates ! They are extremely convenient for both business and leisure purposes as they travel directly to the destination without stopover. Also, their frequent flier program is slightly flawed. I have taken 10 flights this year yet I need to make 5 more to be eligible for a silver card.

"On the evening of 28 August, 2016 I arrived at the airport 3 hours before departure having already checked in online. I went straight to the self-check-in machines and within less than a minute printed my boarding card. All good.
Then the debacle began - it took me 1 hour and 20 minutes to check my bag (and that process took less than a minute). The airline that calls itself 'The Pride of Africa' has no facility for international travellers to drop their bags. You join the (extremely long) check-in queue and shuffle along whilst only TWO check-in attendants were on duty (out of 7 counters). That took 80 minutes.
No management anywhere to be seen.
No apologies to the irate passengers who, like me, had their boarding cards and simply wanted to drop off their luggage.
I eventually found a supervisor who, when I asked her why the airline was treating their passengers like this, replied, whilst constantly scrolling down on her phone and without looking up 'I feel you'.
What on earth is that supposed to mean?
I then started talking to KQ on Facebook begging them to send more check-in personal. They also said sorry but did nothing.
I then sent many messages asking for an explanation (all available for the airline to see) but nothing was forthcoming.
I received a cut-and-paste-get-rid-of-this-passenger-quickly email apology which was utterly meaningless. I replied saying not good enough. I was then asked to log onto their customer services portal to continue the discussion. More hoops for what?
I am a member of the tourism industry in Kenya and am ashamed and heartbroken by the dismissive and dreadful service offered by the national airline. I don't think they care a hoot.
All well and good but I would urge any customers who have a choice to avoid flying KQ at all costs. If not, good luck with the queues and budget many hours for check-in and don't bother using preprinted boarding cards - just adds to your frustration.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/9d/5d/30/nickyfitz54.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickyFitzKenya,NickyFitzKenya wrote a review Sep 2016,NickyFitzKenya,"Johannesburg, South Africa",44 contributions,56 helpful votes,Nairobi - Johannesburg,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r413857860-Kenya_Airways-World.html,I did all I could to get Kenya Airways to communicate with me,Date of travel: August 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have been using Kenya Airlines for over ten years and have always found them to be good however I do not like the Dreamliner which they now use on long haul flights. This plane feels cramped compared to the 777s which they used to fly. The seating is just too tight. This aircraft has the same three rows of three seats as the 777 but the whole plane is narrower making the seating and aisles narrower. On my last flight I was hit more than once by the trolly as the cabin crew pushed it up the narrow aisle and the passenger next to me took up the armrest. On internal flights in Kenya they use the Embrayer 190 and this is an excellent, comfortable aircraft.

Overall Kenya Airways are a good airline with competant pilots and friendly cabin crew. The food is ok and there is plenty of free drink if you ask for it. Prices are if anything slightly lower than they were ten years ago.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/765ianh,Ian H wrote a review Aug 2016,Ian H,"Kelso, United Kingdom",26 contributions,18 helpful votes,Edinburgh - Mombasa,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r412467483-Kenya_Airways-World.html,I am a regular user of Kenya Airways.,Date of travel: April 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"After flying in from Montreal, Canada on June 23rd, I had a connecting flight London-Nairobi-Kilimanjaro with Kenya Airways KQ 101. In London, I double-checked with one of their employee to make sure my luggage was going straight to Kilimanjaro. After calling somebody in charge of luggage, the employee confirmed that was the final destination.

The plane ( a bit old with worn out seats) was delayed in London for 2 hours (we stayed in the plane in very hot conditions waiting for departure). I missed the connection on Flight KQ 0432 to Kilimanjaro. On my insistence, I was re-booked on Flight PW 722 with Precision Air that left the same morning at 8:00 am. When we got there 9 passenger did not have their luggage. Two of them, who we're climbing the Kilimanjaro the next day, had been given the same reassuring speech about their luggage in London...

Logically, I did not expect my luggage to be on that last flight (because of the short delay), but I expected it later on in the day. Unfortunately, it seems that it had never left London (according to information given by the company when they found it) and was redirected finally on June 27th 2016. I got it on June 29th 2016 fortunately because our tour operator(Simba Safari) had the courtesy to bring it where I was in my journey. Meanwhile, everyday from the 24th to the 27th of June, when we've called to have information, they said it was coming in the day...

Since I was leaving for a 7 day safari on the morning of June 25th, I went to buy some clothes.

A few days after my return home, I've sent a formal complaint by e-mail to the company, on July 12th 2016 and a following e-mail on July 29th 2016. Besides the automated reply mentioning an incident number and that the matter would be resolved by July 15th 2016, not a word from Kenya Airways.

I must say I was very disappointed by this first experience with Kenya Airways. Not only by the delayed luggage, but also by the fact that the connection to Kilimanjaro was not held, even though 15 to 20 people had to take that connection. As I mentioned before,I also had to insist on being booked on the next available flight that day, because they had decided to book me on a flight leaving at 4:00pm (some we're booked on a flight to Zanzibar at 11:30pm!). I would have spent another 9 hours uselessly at Nairobi Airport for a 50 minute flight.

I read that the company is restructuring. I think they should pay more attention to customer service if they want to maintain their clientele. That applies even after the flight.

In all fairness, through all these events, employees of Kenya Airways were always courteous.

My other flight (at the end of my safari) with Kenya Airways, Kilimanjaro-Nairobi-Zanzibar went without a glitch. The plane was a recent one and very nice.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/04/35/d1/89/fmlaffs.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fmlaffs,fmlaffs wrote a review Aug 2016,fmlaffs,Montreal,22 contributions,39 helpful votes,London - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r412051290-Kenya_Airways-World.html,"Not sure about ""The pride of Africa"".",Date of travel: June 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I fly Kenya Airways every year to Kenya and have found that they are now economising on their free meal add on and drinks. Complimentary nuts are now served as and when they like and for the fares they charge they will price themselves out of the market. The only advantage they have over this route is they have a direct flight which saves time but Ethiopian and other airlines are giving a good service for fares charged. Food is of average quality and can be improved. They have some way to go to recover some of their former glory i.e. Pride Of Africa.

"First check in at Kigali, the ticket number in their system was different from the ticket number I showed them. Instead of explaining it clearly, the attendant just told us to go sit and wait. After asking why and telling her that we won't move from there until she provides us with an explanation, she decided to tell us. A supervisor came and issue resolved.
We only had one hour to connect at Nairobi, flight took off with a 30 minutes delay. Service during the flight was good. We landed in Nairobi at least 40 minutes before the take off of our connecting flight, but had a very long taxi and looked like the crew on the ground was not ready. Consequence, lost close to 25 minutes. When we got off the plane we only had 15 minutes, not enough to catch our flight.
Our flight to Paris had to be rescheduled. Totally disorganized at this level. There were at least 20 people who missed their flight (Paris or Amsterdam), First attendant did not know what to do, sent us to another office downstairs. Since we missed our flight to Paris, the flight to the US with Delta had to be rescheduled. After several attempts, they managed to secure us seats on the flight to Paris. They told us that we would get the boarding passes for the flights to the US later that day, but everything was OK, reservations confirmed. We left for the hotel. Had to wait another 1 hour in the bus to the hotel (only bus, had to wait for the whole group before leaving), for a trip that took us 45 minutes.
Bus expected to pick us at 8:00PM at the hotel (got there at 2:30 AM). Bus sent to pick us up showed up at 9:00 PM, one hour late, after several calls to their office.
Got at the airport and went to ask for the boarding passes for our flight from France to the U.S. It seemed like the reservation made during the night was cancelled (no reason given), had to start over the whole process. It took the attendant two hours trying to get us the seats confirmed without success. Left Nairobi not knowing if we would get seats on a connecting flight from Paris to LAX. Enjoyed their service in the plane, but anxious on whether would be able to be back on time for work.
Thanks to Air France personnel at Paris, it only took them 5 minutes to have the issue fixed.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cl0d01,cl0d01 wrote a review Aug 2016,cl0d01,"San Diego, California",13 contributions,,Kigali - Paris,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r411239349-Kenya_Airways-World.html,"New planes, good service in air, but poor service on the ground!",Date of travel: July 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"You show up to the airport three hours early (5:15am) with a confirmed reservation for a 9 hour flight with connecting flights, and you are told that they oversold the flight and you are on standby.  You will be put on the next available flight and be paid some ""small compensation"" for the inconvenience.  It's not clear why you drew the short straw why others are checking in just fine. In 25 years of flying this has never happened to me. Obviously all the airlines are doing this trick where, in an attempt to always fly full, they end up overbooking flights.  Most now have this system down pat, and offer increasingly large offers to entice people with flexible plans to take the payout and go on standby.  It's probably efficient, though a bit galling.  Leave it to Kenyan Airways and their incompetence to instead use a system where random, now livid, people are bumped off the flight and only promised some ""small compensation"".  Suggestions to to the team manager in Nairobi (Wanza) to make an announcement asking flexible travellers to volunteer went nowhere.

"The problem begins when they change the flight from an afternoon flight to an early morning flight. Of course when you're traveling and make arrangements well in advance you can't cancel or change other reservations.The check in  person  from Kenya Airways attempted to extort $10 from for the baggage. He actually said "" I was trying to see if you pay it"". Once on board the Embraer 190, I find it to be small and uncomfortable with no working Entertainment System or air conditioning. The stewardesses,Victoria, was either naturally grouchy or having a bad hair day. I don't expect to have a waste bag forced in front of my face to put a towel in, and I don't expect to told ""it's over there"" when I asked for some water.

"I paid 3 months in advance for a return trip from JKIA to Malindi departing in the late afternoon on 4th August and returning on 10th August on the evening flight. Our experience was that Kenya Airways cancelled both of the flights we booked within 1 week of our departure and rebooked us on 5th Aug 08.00 and on 10th August at 09.00.
The first change meant that we had to book another night of accommodation in Nairobi and the second gave us the prospect of a 15hr layover at JKIA before our return flight to London. On the 3rd Aug we were informed by email that our 08.00 flight to Malindi had been cancelled and we were rebooked on a Jambo Jet flight at 09.40 on the 5th. During the evening of the 4th Aug our Jambo Jet flight time was changed to 11.00 back to 09.40 and then back to 11.00 in the space of 2 hours with the final change after 10pm when we were asleep. We ended up at the airport at 08.00 in case the flight was on time, the flight finally took off at around 13.30 and we arrived in Malindi nearly a day late which in a 6 day visit is quite significant. We rebooked our return flight from Mombasa in the evening of the 10th to avoid wasting another day of our holiday in JKIA. Kenya Airways is strong on communicating how sincere they are about the inconvenience caused by the series of changes however, not a single member of their staff expressed any regrets and no compensation of any sort was offered. The additional costs we incurred included a £60 taxi cost to get to Mombasa airport, in addition to the hotel in Nairobi plus the delayed arrival inconvenience. Our experience was one of incompetence and complete lack of regard for their customers.

"Our Kenya Airways flight from Kilimanjaro Airport (JRO) to Livingstone Airport (LVI) via Nairobi (NBO) was booked by Air France Flying Blue team, through our Marriott Rewards redeemable points. I can honestly say that we were very impressed and loved flying Kenya Airways for the first-time within east-central and south-central flown part of our African Escapade.                                           The plane was super-clean, seats were spacious and comfortable, the food and beverages served were one of the best, and especially the whole-cashews snack-pouch was delightfully filling and tasty; they served the highest-quality, humongous-sized cashews we ever ate. The attendants were also cool about giving these snacks a few more extras to munch on with your drink. I saved a couple for later. The crew on-board were very friendly, had a good sense of humor and they were willing to assist you in every way they could. Bathrooms in the plane were the best I ever experienced flying domestic or anywhere international. With wider and deepest sinks I ever used in a flight and easy-operating sink-faucets like the ones at home, their bathrooms were the most spacious, cleanest and the best  on-board. We didn’t use Wi-Fi but I believe it was not offered on this flight. With comfortable seats we took a snooze instead.                                         We flew about an hour from JRO to NBO, and it was a little over 2-hour layover at Nairobi Airport where we had lunch at their new terminal opened early 2015. There were spacious lounges, cafes, restaurants, shops and had an easy access to nice bathrooms at all nearby Gates and exits throughout the new terminal at Nairobi Jomo Kenyatta International. They’ve made the terminal exceptionally easy to navigate, very convenient and the most comfortable I experienced on the continent. The Airport staff at our gate’s departure was very friendly, courteous, accommodating and most importantly very patient when we arrived slightly late. We were completely unaware, and did not know that we had to board a transit-bus at the tarmac from our departure-gate to the aircraft; they calmed our anxiety down and helped us board the bus in time, although we weren’t late or the last to board. Our onward flight to Livingstone was also very comfortable. On our return flight we stayed/slept overnight in Aspire Lounge of JK Nairobi Intl. Airport. At US$30 for 3-hrs., we paid $180 for 6-hrs for the three of us. The Lounge was comfortable with good food and drinks laid out on counters, a TV sitting area, and the night-host/attendant joined together armless sofa-chairs for us to sleep. There are no showers in Aspire Lounge, but it was a good lounge to get a bite to eat, grab a drink, relax/doze off, and the staff is willing to help you with anything.                                      When compared to taking any domestic flights within North American continent, we are quite impressed and pleased to say that on the African side of planet, the Kenya Airways flight, its crew and its Airport staff surpassed our expectations.

"Was rebooked weeks before our trip to Zanzibar on another much longer return flight to Amsterdam with a long nightly stopover in the plane at Dar es Salaam. Unlike other pax could not sleep much. Zanzibar airport delightfully old fashioned.

"Experience of a 17 year old girl travelling alone:

""I started my trip from Daressalaam Tanzania to Germany on Sunday evening. I had everything with me, tickets and boardingpasses. I was at the Airport early enough, means three hours before planned departure
The flight got delayed to leave Dar going to NBI. Usually I would have had 59 minutes to change the plane, now I had only a few minutes, but I still made it to the Boarding gate in time. As I arrived at the gate 19, I was told that they only have one seat for one passenger and they gave this one seat to an adult person, although I had my boarding pass and seat number. Now, I am a girl of 17 years, means according to law I am still under age, not an adult yet, and I am travelling alone, no parent or friend with me. Now, they decided to leave me as girl alone behind in an foreign country. The ticket was booked and payed for in March this year- no last minute ticket.
After that I was sent to the Kenya Airways Service Counter, there they told me that they see going to rebook my flight for another day. The Lady who was working on my Boarding Ticket didn't give me the Information I needed, I asked what will happen when I arrive in Paris? She couldn't give me a proper answer to that, she sometimes told me u will be flying to Amsterdam and i asked Amsterdam? Why? Then she told me no you are flying to Paris.The Lady then went somewhere to work for my Ticket and took a really long time about 30 min or so, when she came back she gave me my Boarding Ticket and I was then sent to the immigration to get a stamp. I got my stamp, and was then sent to the Kenya Airways Hotel Counter, I arrived there and they gave me my old and my new Boarding Ticket, they told me to which Hotel I was going to. I had to wait for the transport that took us to the Hotel, which later I discovered has realy bad reviews in the internet.I was in the Airport for 2hrs And 36 mins because of this things above. I reached the hotel at 2:40 am at night. I left NBI 24 hrs later then the original flight, then reached Paris and had to wait another 10 hours for the next flight to my final destination Bremen in Germany. I was left with no place to rest and no food at all. everybody told me, they are not responsible. A flight which was supposed to take 12 hrs took me more than 48 hours. My written complains via email to the airline up to now have just been left unanswered. School opened at 4th August and from the Date 1st -3rd August I had things to accomplish before school starts e.g. appointments with the doctor etc. all this could not be done because of my delayed flight.""

"The flight itself was fine but we were unable to check-in in advance either on the internet or by direct call to Kenya Airways nor were we able to check-in for the second leg of our trip at Toronto Airport where we started our journey. Fortunately all three of us were seated together. But one item of baggage was not transferred from our Toronto-Amsterdam flight and it took us an unreasonable amount of time to report the details in Jomo Kenyatta airport. The driver who was waiting for us left because if one of us exited the airport to find him, she would not be able to get back in. We were the last people to leave the airport -- we watched as they chained the airport doors closed. To their credit, they delivered the piece of luggage to us in the Maasi Mara three days later.

I flew from Freetown to Nairobi And it is comfortable, services was good, on time and my transfer to another airlines with my luggage went smooth.

However, I had a vey bad inflight experience as the lady who was serving us had a very bad attitude. You had to literally remind her to serve you and this for me was unacceptable and such a shame for an airline that generally offers decent in flight experience even in the economy side of traveling.

KQ puts one of their new planes - a Dreamliner, on this segment and it is a worthy experience.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/8b/avatar012.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ajei2000,Ajei2000 wrote a review Aug 2016,Ajei2000,"Nairobi, Kenya",151 contributions,35 helpful votes,London - Nairobi,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r401199129-Kenya_Airways-World.html,One of the top three African Airlines,Date of travel: July 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Kenya airways is one of the big three African Airlines, the others being South African Airlines and Ethiopian Airways. While the inflight experience of Kenya airways is great, the most annoying thing is that they are perpetually late. This particular flight was delayed but even the flight I took to Kamala on 1st August was delayed. This is the operational nuisance that the airline needs to fix and fix quickly.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/8b/avatar012.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ajei2000,Ajei2000 wrote a review Aug 2016,Ajei2000,"Nairobi, Kenya",151 contributions,35 helpful votes,Entebbe - Nairobi,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r401173231-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Pride of Africa,Date of travel: August 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Probably one of the best things about flying with this airline is the weight of luggage they allow. But do make sure that any one bag does not exceed 20 kg. This way you can have check in luggage of up to 40 kg and still have carry on luggage etc.
Although they are not rated as one of the top airlines of the world, it is a very convenient and cheaper option to fly long distances, although flights may be few and far apart, so make sure you book way in advance.
Also - be sure to wear very easy clothes as you will have to remove your shoes, belt and any other garment/ accessory that may contain metal EVEN when you just do a climb over at Kenyata airport in Nairobi. It may also be handy to have a small fold up bag ready that you can dump all the items you had to take off in so you can easily get them on the other side of the scanner. They do provide plastic baskets for this, but there are way too few of them and you may end up having to leave your stuff on the floor.
Should you have to wait some time at the airport I would advise that you have a few $US handy, since the restaurants do not have credit card facilities and the places that do are sometimes offline or the connection can be very slow.
My flight was cancelled at very short notice, and since I was a single traveler - they proposed to get me on a flight of their affiliated airline Ethiopian Air. This helped a lot and Ethiopian is not a bad low cost airline either. Should you encounter a problem like this, you may want to ask if they can move you over to Ethiopian Airways. I do however believe they can only do this for one or two passengers since they have to be sure of availability of seats.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/97/33/65/max-m.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaxM93,Max M wrote a review Aug 2016,Max M,"Patong, Thailand",23 contributions,54 helpful votes,Bangkok - Johannesburg,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r401169261-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Surprisingly good service from a low cost airline,Date of travel: April 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Unfortunately the flight was delayed for close to 2 hours. The first 40 minute delay was communicated to me by text. Then at the airport there was further delay of another 40 odd minutes as they were trying to verify the passenger list. I ended up missing my connecting flight and was bundled into a midnight flight meaning I spent a night flying instead of resting at home. To make matters worse at JKIA Kenya Airways officials were very rude when I made inquiries of arrangements such as food while waiting for the late connecting flight,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EMoyo,EMoyo wrote a review Aug 2016,EMoyo,Lilongwe,99 contributions,21 helpful votes,Lubumbashi - Dar es Salaam,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r401167851-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Too many delays,Date of travel: July 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Although not sensational, the Dreamliner is pleasant to fly in: light and spacious. I don't like the automatic dimming of the windows as I like to look out occasionally.
The staff were pleasant enough. One stewardess took the trouble to find me a new seat as I was nearly pushed out of my initial seat by an over-large passenger. The breakfast basically consisted of white flour, fat and sugar, plus a sausage. Not great. Lunch was sparse but quite tasty. The piece of cake for dessert was very dry and no joy to eat. When disembarking we did not get the customary ""thank you and good bye"" which felt a bit nonchalant.

"So I flew to Nairobi last week for the first time in many many years and I'll have to say the flight was super smooth! First of all, we left ahead of schedule which was awesome and we were there before my episode of Jane the virgin..

The cabin crew were good and their uniforms are hella cool, like there was a KQ on this one guys belt. Very suave! Though there was a screen in front of me, I didn't see any headphones nearby so that left me hanging. There was a USB port maybe to charge your phone but I didn't use it so I'm not sure if it worked.

"Non-existent rather negative customer service. I had to cancel my one leg of my flight due to some work and these people canceled my whole flight. Nothing can be fixed on the phone, I had to go to the airport to get it fixed. Where they asked for $800 to reinstate the ticket which cost me $400 for the whole return trip. With this nonsense sorted and me paying only $200 extra when I turned up for my flight they again didn't have my booking. Fortunately I had time to spare and managed to fix it...which took 2 hrs.

"Kenya airlines is a proud African airline which i used From OR Tambo Johannesburg to Douala Cameroon. However, on like other airlines on the same route, there is serious need to either improve on hostesses customer service or for management to improve on motivating staff. That was not even the main issue. my shock was when we were on transit at Nairobi. it was at night and the next flight was the following morning. we were arrogantly told we would have to pass the night at the airport and sleep on the hard benches at the airport till dawn. onlike other airlines (name withheld), we are put into 4 and 5 star hotels during transit. cold hard benches, no blankets, no food, no water, nothing till morning. Now that is not value for money, that is an example of the worst ever customer service i ever experience and would always quote this everywhere during my presentations

"This was the first time I had flown with Kenya Airways. We left left from Terminal 3 and the flight left on time. I chose Kenya Airways because the flight schedule suited me, it was very competitively priced and passengers are give a 2 X 23 kg luggage allowance.

The flight was comfortable enough, the crew were very friendly and helpful and the film selection was good. Airline can be variable but I found the food to be perfectly tasty and adequate.

I was flying to Harare and the stopover was in Nairobi for about three hours. Nairobi airport is passable and there are adequate places to sit and have a coffee. The flight time from London toNairobi was approx eight hours and then two hours from there to Haare.

"The good stuff: The entertainment doesn't stop for take off or landing, you can watch movies all along. Worth bringing your own headset and an airplane adapter cheap of ebay, because the quality of sound on the headset provided is poor.

That's about all the positives.

First of all, the staff on the flight were plain rude. Zero communication skills. If you didn't quite catch what they said or wanted, they would just hover over you with a frown, without saying what they were after for the second time until you magically discovered what was going on. For example when serving hot beverages tea and coffee were served couple minutes apart. No big deal. The cart is approaching, I'm saying coffee please and put the cup on the tray. Not a word. Just a frown. Could I get some coffee please? So they would not say straight away that it's gonna be served separately and I should take mu cup back, they would just stand there with an impatient expression growing.

The attendants plain ignore the 'require assistance' light. My friend had it on for 12 minutes, no reaction whatsoever, an attendant passed her by with a tea pot but did not bother to stop and ask what's going on. Fortunately, all my friend needed was a drink, so having noted these are being served she switched the light off. Had she needed anything more serious she might as well forget it unless you start kicking and screaming that you need help. Which gets awkward if you're not dying, but just need some discreet assistance.

Food was ok, the main course was a bit too salty, but I could live with that. The croissant on the connecting flight to Mombasa tasted like genuine English mould, scraped off the cellar wall. At least that's what it smelled of. I'm not sure it was stored in improper conditions or what the cause was. You don't get drinks outside of your set meal times (the light gets ignored if you turn it on) so bring your own water even if you feel you're not going to need some, as the air gets really dry on this long flight.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0b/c8/9f/4c/savrii.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/savrii,savrii wrote a review Aug 2016,savrii,,7 contributions,13 helpful votes,London - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r400543310-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Customer service is non existent,Date of travel: July 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Kenya Airways (KQ) has one redeeming quality, which is its fleet consisting of relatively modern aircraft (787, Embraer etc.). Unfortunately, the KQ's staff (particularly those working at Nairobi JKIA) seem utterly demotivated, and some are outright hostile towards customers. The contempt for paying customers is evident from the moment you enter JKIA, and sadly it rarely ends once you board the aircraft. I have had the misfortune to witness many incidents of Kenya Airways staff harassing and shouting down passengers who dared to complain. Interesting, KQ staff seem to have a particular disdain for their fellow Africans. It is truly unfortunate that Kenya Airways' managers do not care about their company's international reputation, nor do they worry about the damage their shoddy management is doing to the entire tourism industry in Kenya.

"I have been flying Kenya Airways for the past 5 years. Some of the planes 5 years ago had seen better days. But today, KA also fly the Dreamliner. I now regularly fly on one between Nairobi and Johannesburg, which is just a 4 hour flight. So my question to KA is, why don't you use the Dreamliner on the 9-10 hour flight across to Freetown. You fly 7 days a week, which is great, and the flights are always full, so I just wish you would upgrade the plane for such a long flight, and if capacity is the problem, cut back slightly on the number of flights,
Another small gripe is that I have been a Flying Blue Silver Card member for most of those 5 years, though I did lose that status when you stopped flying because of Ebola, but I now have it back again. In all that time I have never been upgraded once. There aren't many perks for being a Silver Card holder.
One more comment. In all of my 5 years of flying with KA, I have never received bad service from 1 of your cabin staff. They are all to be highly commended. South African Airways can learn something from your staff.

"This was my first time travelling on Kenya Airways and I was a bit apprehensive but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. I traveled from Dubai to Nairobi (KQ311) and then connected to Cape Town (KQ782) with a 40 minute stopover in Livingstone, Zambia. In Livingstone some people got off and the plane was cleaned/tidied, even the pillow cases of the vacant seats were changed which I thought was a nice touch since I haven't seen this done before. The check-in was smooth and efficient, I especially liked the fact that I got 2 bags of 23kg each checked in luggage and the same applied to my return flight which was with a different airline. (When you purchase one ticket with different airlines, the baggage allowance of the first airline applies. I flew back with EK and had no problem checking in with the extra baggage allowance. FYI. Flights were booked on Orbitz) Both flights were very comfortable, the aircraft's were clean and the pilots kept us up to date throughout of the flights, informing us ahead of time when we would experience some turbulence, etc. The connection between the two flights was quick and efficient. The aircraft between Nairobi and Cape Town had leather seats which I didn't expect but I really liked. The in-flight entertainment didn't work but to be honest I really didn't mind. The screen is quite small though and I most probably wouldn't have enjoyed watching a movie on it anyway. The food is average but adequate. Don't expect any of the luxuries that you would experience when flying with bigger, more popular airlines, you get what you pay for.  If you are looking for a clean, comfortable, value for money airline, then this is it.  I will definitely fly with them again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/327rener,Rene R wrote a review Jul 2016,Rene R,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",48 contributions,6 helpful votes,Dubai - Cape Town Central,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r398311698-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Pleasantly surprised,Date of travel: July 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Flew Kenyan Airways in the month of May .Not only was the flight delayed but also our bags didn't arrive.Imagine our quandary because not only were we missing our sightseeing for the day with all the late baggage formalities,but also had to come back at night as we were told bags would be arriving then.Another trip to the airport proved in vain as the bags still didn't arrive.The staff at Nairobi was helpful though in getting all our forms sorted and formalities filled out ,as the very next day we were to depart for our African Safari as everything was already booked well in advance.We had absolutely nothing with us since we were not even having any cabin baggage but luckily our driver knew of a 24 hour open mall where we shopped for nightsuits and essentials and toiletries and jackets way past midnight! With the clothes on our back we travelled place to place till we were reunited with our luggage after 4 days !

"Our flight from Nairobi to Bangkok was cancelled and we only found out after queueing 30 minutes to drop off our bags after checking in online. There was no communication at all to inform us prior to us reaching the airport. The first ground staff whom we encountered could only tell us he did not know anything, his supervisor was not around and we were to wait for further instructions. He seemed extremely eager to go off duty.
We were kept waiting for another hour for a lady staff to show up and issue hotel accommodation vouchers. When she showed up, she just took our boarding passes and wrote out everything by hand slowly. When we asked what other flights we could take, she just carried on writing out vouchers for other passengers, ignoring us until we pressed further. The reply was extremely unhelpful. We were to wait till tomorrow morning to check in and we would find out what flight we could take. By then, this was already 11pm. We had been at the airport since 930pm. This lady's name was Immaculate. She was dismissive and basically displayed an attitude that was highly unsuitable for customer service.
We waited another hour to get to the only staff who was actually helping stranded passengers. Unfortunately, he was stuck helping a group of passengers check in their bags for close to an hour. The poor staff, Derrick, was left alone to deal with the crisis as all his colleagues on duty at that time just ditched him and disappeared despite the fact that there were more than 20 people waiting.
He tried to get us flights back to Singapore but the only option that would get us back in time for our commitments was to transit in 7 hours in Mumbai. Imagine if we had listened to Immaculate and just showed up the next day only to realise that we might have been stranded yet again.
By now, it was close 2 am after everything had been sorted out. We went to the bus provided to bring us to the hotel which was supposed a 5 star hotel as told to us by the ground staff but the situation became even more farcical from this point onwards. We were told it was only 10 to 15 minutes. After 30 minutes of driving, the bus driver brought us to the first Pride Hotel. It was discovered that it was the wrong one after some passengers. The same thing occurred when we were driven to the second. Only by the third try was it correct cos they have exhausted all the options for Pride Hotel in Nairobi. By this time, it was 240am.
Check in was a mess with tired passengers trying to get rooms. When we got to our rooms, there was no bedsheets and pillowcases. When my friend asked for them, the hotel receptionist said then you can give up your rooms to this couple who did not get one (yes, Kenya Airways actually issued hotel vouchers but did not Ensure that there were enough rooms for stranded passengers). Pride Hotel is definitely not a 5 star hotel.
By the time we got to sleep, it was 3am. We had to leave the hotel by 5am to catch our 7am flight out of Nairobi. The bus to the airport left only at 525am cos we were all waiting for one passenger. By the time we got to the airport, it was 610am and we needed to board at 630am. This meant a mad rush through all different checkpoints.
We made it to our flight barely on time.
By the time we landed in Mumbai, I was having gastric issues, no thanks to the lack of sleep, stress and dehydration cos it took very long to get water on board the flight. However, we were stuck in the transit area and were told we needed to wait til 730pm to get into the area where we could get access to food. This was at 430pm. And this reason for this was because Kenya Airways did not issue our boarding passes for the connecting flight. Thankfully, the ground staff at Mumbai airport were much more helpful. They arranged for an airport doctor to see me and they issued temporary boarding passes so that I could at least get food which Kenya Airways did not pay for despite the fact that it was their fault we were diverted.
The whole chain of events on that night/day was a debacle. Having flights cancelled is usual and cannot be avoided but what could have been avoided is the lack of apologies and the desire to at least help stranded passengers get home. Kenya Airways should look into more training for staff in managing crises especially for this particular staff called Immaculate and have a proper SOP. It only managed to make tired and confused passengers angrier and angrier through the long waits, lack of information and apologies, and avoidable mistakes at different points.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jrt95,Jrt95 wrote a review Jul 2016,Jrt95,"Singapore, Singapore",19 contributions,5 helpful votes,Nairobi - Bangkok,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r396058941-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Horrible service recovery for flight cancellation,Date of travel: July 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I have used Kenya Airways for four years now and i have to say there dreamliner product is very good. The crew are very welcoming and the service is true african style welcoming! The down fall of the airline is the Nairobi airport, the upgraded airport still isn't quite to standard in my books. The KQ lounge is ok and does the job however there aren't towels in the shower area, the food offering is ok. The lounge is new so that is the plus. Staff are good and friendly however the price of the ticket i would rather fly Qatar for a slightly better experience all round. The flight from Nairobi to JNB is very good in the new aircraft. The seats are comfortable and the entertainment system isn't bad at all. The food on board is good and there offering of drinks is good. The reason they aren't my first choice airline for flights to Africa is a combination of flyblue program, airport layover product,  experience based on price and the all round product.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f3/e4/default-avatar-2020-30.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeeTPiont,BeeTPiont wrote a review Jul 2016,BeeTPiont,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",113 contributions,135 helpful votes,Dubai - Johannesburg,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r392890980-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Flight was excellent,Date of travel: January 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We mentioned to the stewardess who went to see if it could be fixed ,came back and spoke to others but I had to ask her again. She did say she was sorry that nothing could be done.

"I have traveled with Kenya airways for many years however the organisation over the last 2 years has left much to be desired!  I have booked 9 flights with KQ in the last 2 years and only 3 flights went as originally booked. There have been numerous changes of departure times (sometimes with no information to me). Some of the changes have caused considerable extra expense with travel times to the airport, never once did any of the messages suggest an apology etc! When the Pilots went on strike there was very little info and when there was confusion over the flights KQ cancelled my return flight with no communication to me at all! They then demanded a $50 dollar fine to re-instate me on the flight which was not full!  I took another airline which was cheaper than KQ!

"I recently returned from Botswana via Nairobi. Outward flight from LHR to Nairobi Kenya Air did not have any wine, red or white, no whisky, no brandy, no beer, only neat gin or vodka and no mixers, ie. tonic to go with them. Therefore the only drink available was neat gin or vodka.

On the return trip the main meal they had run out of and only had a fish pie to which I am allergic. So I was served for the main meal from Nairobi to London SIX PACKETS OF NUTS. Is this the best Kenya Airways can do or are they going bust? A disgraceful standard of service both ways.

If you fly with Kenya Airways I suggest you take your own drinks and food.

"We had made several flights with Kenya Airways. First flight was from Nairobi to Antananarivo. Our Luggage (and the luggage of half of the plain!!) didn't arrive. Not a big problem but they refused to bring the luggage to our hotel. We had to pick it up at the airport ourselves at our own cost eventhough at their website they state they would bring it to your hotel. When we arrived at the airport we found out that the flight our luggage was on had a 3 hour delay and the didn't even contact us (they had our number) so we had to wait at the airport for 3 hours.
On our return flight we flew with Kenya Airways from Nairobi to Paris. We were in the front of the plain where it was so hot I couldn't even sleep. Also my screen didn't work and when I asked the flight attendent to restart it they couldn't care less. They made me feel guilty I asked.
Food also really bad! No taste, patatoes with spinach and white beans for breakfast, no desert.

"Boarded on time at 145am in the dark - no power on the plane and no warning or explanation given. As the aircon wasn't working & plane full, the atmosphere was humid. After my complaint about lack of communication the pilot attempted to speak to passengers (30 mins after boarding) but the megaphone wouldn't work!

Eventually under way approx 90 mins late, giving a chase to gate in Nairobi, where flight to Amsterdam had been held.

Late into AMS so missed KLM connection to Leeds. Later plane to Leeds overbooked so offered option of Teesside, Manchester or overnight stay. Heard mention of Humberside, enquired, booked.

A 4 hour+ wait, home 5 hours 35 mins late. Son did 150 miles to collect me.

The whole trip was booked via KLM. They referred my email to Kenya Airways as they caused the delay. KA automated reply promised answer in 48 hours. I received one over a week later informing that as their flight was less than 3 hours late they would pay no compensation. I would have accepted £50 for my son.

Have flown KLM/KA 6 times since 2009, a total of 16 passenger. We have 10 to 12 people to go in 2017. WILL NOT BE FLYING KLM/KA.

Have flown with Ethiopian, SAA, LAM, and other smaller airline companies but within Africa consider Kenyan Airlines.",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L6802EHantonios,Antonio S wrote a review Apr 2016,Antonio S,Canada,32 contributions,27 helpful votes,Entebbe - Bujumbura,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r368647127-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Best Airline in Africa,Date of travel: April 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"NSI is a decent airport. The waiting area for the KQ flight is air conditioned and the lounge available provides drinks and limited pastries, as well as good WiFi. The flight coming in was late by 1 hour. Boarding was smooth and orderly. The seats were old and hard - hardly any cushioning left. Entertainment was provided through a central TV system, rather than on-demand screens. A meal was served for the four-hour flight and was tasty. However, upon collecting the trays, the flight attendant dropped a cup of cola which splashed up on the passengers, their trays, and the overhead luggage bins. The flight attendant helped the passengers clean up, but did not wipe the dripping cola from the overhead bins. Due to the delayed departure, we had to run to our connection and our bags did not make it. Instead, the bags came in on the next available flight (4am). We had to argue to have the bags delivered to the hotel in Kamapala prior to the start of our day, rather than the 8:30am-4:30pm window originally offered.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/eb/43/default-avatar-2020-11.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G8ormike,Mike wrote a review Apr 2016,Mike,"Atlanta, Georgia",201 contributions,49 helpful votes,Yaounde - Entebbe,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r366510487-Kenya_Airways-World.html,"Pleasant enough, but some mishaps",Date of travel: April 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I am always up to try new airlines even though I have had some pretty terrible trips (the nightmares make better stories) and if I had written this review after my outbound flight it would have been filled with happy words.  Nice plane, good food and entertainment, and well-stocked bar.  The flight attendants were helpful and didn't act like I was a criminal when I asked for more wine.  The internal flight was good although it ended up costing me $90 USD instead of the $50 USD I had been quoted to change the day my flight went from Nairobi to Malindi.I was on safari from the 1st to the 6th and did not bring my computer.  I checked in on the 7th and paid for the change.  The people I dealt with did not mention that the return portion of my ticket had been changed.  I only found out that the Malindi to Nairobi leg of my flight had been changed because of another traveller. I went to the Kenya Airways office in Malindi and after waiting for an hour while another traveller complained about something, I decided to try to get the information another way.The reception at my hotel was able to get me on-line where the on-line check in said there was a 'problem' with my ticket so he called the customer service line. My flight had been changed to 10 a.m.  Now I would have to wait approx. 12 hours in Nairobi Airport. Kenya Airways only has one flight per day to Bangkok.

"The Pride of Africa
Sun 10th April 2016
Arrived 10:10AM to Nairobi from Joburg
Flight KQ412 to EBB supposed to be 11:30
On all screens it shows 11:30 IN TIME
At 11:00 we approached the GATE
On screen still IN TIME, but gate screen has a scrolling text that announce a delay to 15:00
Asked KQ staff if this is true and the reason
Response technical problems on the aircraft and waiting for another aircraft.

Claimed that they should buy us lunch at least, but no response.
This around 12:00 now and still on the screens IN TIME and no PA announcement.
Thinking about the Pride Lounge, but too expensive and no positive response from staff to get it for free as compensation.
Going back to the gate at 14:00, still 11:30 IN TIME on the screens, but the scrolling text that announce a delay to 15:00 on the gate screen.
At 14:40 no staff at the gate, going to “Info desk” and the man there don’t know anything at this moment. He’s calling somewhere, but some other staff appearing and got the info that gate will be opened now.
Walking back to the Gate and still nothing, talked to someone and was told to go to Gate 19.
Moving to Gate 19 and my wife shows her Boarding pass to staff and was rejected and put on waiting list. I do the same and I’m OK and can board the aircraft.
Getting an explanation that the new Aircraft is smaller than the ordinary and not all can board.
Try to explain that I and my wife will not travel separately, but they don’t care.
We are told to wait for the manager, the “manager” arrives and people are really upset
We were told that some (97 of 145) can board this aircraft and the rest will board KQ414 at 16:45.
People start boarding and some still trying to deal with Staff, but now we are told that the flight will be a new flight at 19:00. I have now decided to give away my seat and wait for the 19:00 flight and travel with my wife.
Now we get our new boarding passes and approach for the Pride Lounge. Try to get entrance for free but can’t authorize that, so end up on paying USD 80 for us 2.
Promised a receipt and told to claim from Customer Service, at this moment haven’t got any receipt.
Just been to the gate again and boarded in the system, then they delayed the flight to 20:50
Went back to the Lounge after few minutes they called and told us we can go with flight KQ416 to EBB, but they can’t promise that we get our luggage.
We took the flight and arrived in EBB 21:00, but no Luggage.
For long no one in EBB knew anything about flight KQ414D.
Finally got some information around 23:00 that the flight should arrive EBB 23:40.
Flight arrived at 23:40 and I received 2 of our 3 bags. I started to fill in Claim form, when the lady said that they received 1 bag in my name earlier in the afternoon.
KQ sent 1 bag with the earlier flight and 2 bags with the other flight (very confusing and against international law, all our bags were on board of other planes than us)
Total delay about 12 hours.

The Pride of AFRICA can’t be so pride on this issue
Through the whole day no PA announcement
Information almost nothing, no one knows anything for sure.
Every flight company (maybe outside Africa) compensates people straight, free lunch etc.
Get paid if you give away your seat and take the next flight
For me is the most annoying thing the lack of information, me myself have to drag out some info from different staff, keep someone at the gate to update people. Keep you screens updated.
When you know the plane is smaller inform people in advance so you don’t get the problem at boarding, one day you end up in Riots.

"I have travelled with KQ for the last few years on a monthly basis between the UK and Nairobi on business.

The airline used to be really good. A couple of years ago I'd have chosen KQ over most of its competitors, including European and Asian operators.

I'm very sad to say though that there has been a marked decline in service quality over the past 12 months, and I'm now at the stage where I am scoping alternatives.

I believe there have been cuts in staff, and this is clearly showing now on the 'shop floor'. The customer services desks in Jomo Kenyata Airport are simply awful. What should be simple queries are turning into absolute epics because staff seem to lack even basic knowledge on how to deal with straightforward everyday queries. It's not the fault of the staff - it's a clear training gap.

Last month I had a flight cancelled for the umpteenth time for 'operational reasons' (that old chestnut. The staff informed us we would be put up in a hotel over night. The hotel was less than a mile from the airport. From informing us of the cancellation to getting us into that hotel took them 6 hours!? This delay was entirely down to the customer services staff not having a clue what they were supposed to do.

The online 'help desk' is also utterly useless. Email queries go unanswered. The supposed 'live chat' service goes unanswered. When you do get an advisor, they are rarely able to answer your query satisfactorily.

I have umpteen similar tales. KQ are a shadow of their former selves. As soon as I scope a worthwhile alternative, I shall be taking my business elsewhere.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trevor8920,Trevor8920 wrote a review Apr 2016,Trevor8920,"Inverness, United Kingdom",27 contributions,33 helpful votes,London - Nairobi,International,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r363374695-Kenya_Airways-World.html,"Once a good airline, now in real decline",Date of travel: March 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I admit I was a little sceptical about Kenya Airways.  When we got to the gate for boarding we were told there was a technical problem with the plane and there was going to be a delay.  We ended up being delayed for 2.5 hours as they had to shut down and restart the plane (!!)  Anyway, they boarded us very quickly once they were able to and made up an amazing amount of time during the flight and we landed 25mins after schedule which, considering the late departure, was pretty good.  The plane was new, the service was great, no complaints.

"Our connection flight from Kenya to Bangkok was meant to be a 1.5 hour layover. Instead it turned into a long, smelly and unsafe bus ride to a hotel in an industrial town. We had to wait almost 2 hours for the bus as there were so many people and not enough transport. There were business class passengers squashed onto a rickity mini bus to their hotel. In the morning we were told the bus would collect us at 7am, it arrived at 8:30- with no explanation and constant worry that we may miss our new flight. There was no coordination, the airport was chaos as no one knew which forms to fill out and where we were going. In the end we missed out on a day of Travel in Bangkok, as we arrived at 1am instead of lunch time.  Since then I have done some research and have found that ""cancelled flight due to a technical issues"" is a common occurance on Kenya Airways. The seats were small, the food is very average, some staff were friendly and others were cold. On our way back to South Africa, our flight was delayed again by 30 minutes, we were so worried that we were going to miss our connecting flight to Johannesburg. This was our honeymoon and this experience really put a damper on our long travel to Thailand and added a lot of stress and anxiety ontop of going to a country we had never been to before. The reason we booked Kenya Airways because they had shorter travelling times than some of the other airlines, but in the end it cost us a day of travelling :-( Then the other part was all the timely security checks at the airport,I'm pretty sure this is what leads to the delays.

"Have done this flight many times and have always been satisfied. This time not so....new planes but the aisles were barely wide enough for the trolleys to pass up and down or for that matter people, everytime someone walked by you got a bang from them. The food on the going flight was passable but coming back.......no choice on the first snack, just fish. The breakfast was a fairly unrecognisable mix, a tomato with four pieces of potato, the rest ... well who knows. The cabin crew were not as friendly as usual, quite surely at times, the flight itself otherwise went without hitch, ontime and smooth.

"After reading many of the reviews of KQ on various sites I was very hestitant to book them. The shortage of time and the one stop were the original determining factors. Strange to fly HKG / BKK sector with a crew made up of predominantly Thai nationals on a Kenyan airline. After BKK they were mainly replaced by Kenyan nationals.

"I always travel by KQ on my Africa trips and this is my preferred airline in Africa. Good connectivity and decent service. The dreamliner is a good addition. Other planes are clean as well and staff is courteous. The only problem with the airlines is that it is mostly delayed.

"Night flight from Amsterdam to Nairobi. The plane was brand new but the inflight entertainment system kept crashing in my seat (three times) and it took up to an hour each time to reset. In the end I was asked to move to a middle seat (from aisle) which of course I didn't want to do. The flight attendant had at this point had enough of me and was quite rude about it. They also boasted with inflight wifi, but that wasn't working either. The food was terrible (and I don't expect much from economy class food) it resembled sludge and I didn't eat it. Breakfast was poor (half an orange cut into pieces). I have flown Kenya Airways before and it was quite good but this experience was really disappointing.

"Our outward journey with Kenya Airways was excellent from the check in staff to the flight attendants and food.   Unfortunately the same could not be said about our return journey.   Check in staff at Mombasa were excellent - very helpful and courteous.   At Nairobi airport again the staff were great as we had been delayed so had to rush to departure gate but not a problem.We boarded the fantastic Dreamliner on time.   Had managed to purchase exit seats so again all good.   The disappointment started with supper.   The fish (no choice) was inedible followed by a piece of cake which was so dry it was again a definite no no.   Thank goodness we had some chocolate or it would have been a long hungry night!  The air hostess serving our part of the plane left a lot to be desired.   She was curt and did not really seem to care if we were there or not.   On other airlines water/juice is brought round very regularly during the night but not this time.    I pressed my call button and eventually they brought me water but I felt I was being a total nuisance.   Breakfast was equally disgusting - a very watery dish of omelette, soggy tomato and potato which again was left untouched - such a waste.   Coffee eventually arrived which was ok.Such a disappointment after the wonderful Kenyan people we had met in Mombasa.   During our entire stay we were treated with wonderful smiles by people who could not do enough to help us.

"I booked with KA as it allowed me to allocate seating upon payment.  However, I soon found that this seating plan did not exist when I arrived at the airport with 6'5"" and 6'2"" family members.  Lea at the KA desk in London automatically allocated extra legroom - FREE OF CHARGE - when she saw my family and we travelled in comfort from London to Nairobi.  She was really helpful and understanding of our predicament.  We arrived deliberately early at the airport to secure extra legroom.However, our treatment at Mombasa airport was the opposite with absolutely dire  airport staff refusing to allocate extra legroom unless it was purchased, in Nairobi, at a cost of US$79.00 per person.  I explained the difference in our treatment at London Heathrow Airport and was again, told that I could purchase extra legroom, if available, once in Nairobi for our flight to London as it was all controlled by staff at Nairobi airport.  I was told that IF there were any unpurchased extra legroom seats on our connecting flight, staff MIGHT consider allocating them to my family, but that was not guaranteed. I had to argue the point that my family physically could not fit in economy seats, that there was no way to purchase extra legroom when making my reservation, that I had called the airline in advance to try to arrange this and that it was not the fault of the traveller for being too tall to fit in economy seats.  My family and I were also seated separately, in different rows for our return flights, despite asking at check in to be seated together.  I had to argue to have our seats changed to sitting together after the lady at check in had lied repeatedly saying that the flight was full.  A truly rubbishy service from KA in Kenya.After much arguing at Mombasa airport with a manager named J Ananga, I was permitted to purchase extra legroom seats at Mombasa and not have to wait until our arrival at Nairobi even though we had had free extra legroom seats on our outbound flights.  That said, this involved going in and out of supposed 'security check' areas several times in order to retrieve my credit card, passports etc from the gate area. without anyone batting an eyelid!!

"Staff not helpful. Asked to pay to upgrade to buisness class was told the flight was full. After boarding only 4 people in buisness class. Again requested to pay for upgrade and was told no I couldn't without explanation. I was appropriately dressed and could find no other reason for refusal other than it was to much paperwork!
No drinks were served for 4 and half hours and only after asking twice did I get a a wine. The food was poor. Entertainment had a good selection better than I thought.

"I've used Kenya airways several times and am always impressed with their polite and friendly staff.  The food is not amazing, but it's edible - breakfast is usually good.  The drinks service is generous and the inflight entertainment system usually has a decent range of movies and tv.  Music is a bit basic but better than nothing.  Self check in never works for me, most annoying, but good baggage allowance and an all round good airline in my experience.

"Kenyan Airways is good. Good pilots. Clean aircraft e.g. B 737 series. Aircrew are polite but not too friendly - quite formal.  Nairobi as a hub can be a bit chaotic and ground staff are a bit nonchalant.  Delays at the Hub are quite common. Although arrival is guaranteed, service is not up to some African airlines. Kenyan has a large fleet whose management can be admired. Generally a good African airline",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmmanuelA279,Emmanuel A wrote a review Feb 2016,Emmanuel A,Bern,5 contributions,2 helpful votes,Accra - Monrovia,Africa,Business Class,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r346235708-Kenya_Airways-World.html,A Good African Airline,Date of travel: March 2015,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I am by no means a ""frequent flyer"" but I have to say I found the whole experience of Kenya Airways really good. We were on flight KQ101 Heathrow to Nairobi on a 787 dreamliner, I had chosen seats in row 17 right over the wing as I had read this was the quietist area to be in. There was an impressive choice of films to watch, the food served was quite tasty and the seats, considering this was economy, were quite comfortable. The first leg of our trip was a 7.5 hour flight, followed by a layover of about 5 hours at Nairobi before boarding an Embraer 190, flight KQ780 for a 2.5 hour flight on to Livingstone. Overall I was very impressed with the airline and can definitely recommend them to anybody contemplating a trip to Africa. We booked about 5 months in advance and got our flights for <£500 each, return. For those of you who are plane spotters, the 787 was aircraft no. 5Y-KZH and the Embraer 190 was 5Y-FFG. You can track flight KQ101 on flightradar24 every day from LHR at 19.00 gmt.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/07/60/81/10/gerryatric4.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gerryatric4,Gerryatric4 wrote a review Feb 2016,Gerryatric4,"Barrow-in-Furness, United Kingdom",41 contributions,7 helpful votes,London - Livingstone,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r345753135-Kenya_Airways-World.html,"Good flight, lovely crew, and very affordable.",Date of travel: January 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"Got a chance to fly on a dreamliner...
it was quite a relaxing flight though it was a 6 hour journey thanks to B787's comfortable seats...food was good too...entertainment system had plenty of options right from Hollywood / Bollywood movies to the documentaries..

Cabin crew was very cooperative....they offered good choices for in flight duty free shopping.

and the last but the most unique experience this time on KQ was the wifi connectivity at 35000 ft high. It was a paid service though..",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vishalnc3,Vishalnc wrote a review Jan 2016,Vishalnc,"Houston, Texas",68 contributions,12 helpful votes,Mumbai - Nairobi,International,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r343937236-Kenya_Airways-World.html,Dream Experience on KQ's Dreamliner from Mumbai to Nairobi,Date of travel: January 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"I flew 6 times with this airline and every time I had a nice experience. The staff is nice, well trained (even for medical situations), the food and drinks are excellent and as much as you want. The flight are relatively cheap if you book 2-3 months in advance.
The only weakness I would mention is the delay of the flights, (probably) due to the technical stop they usually do in the neighbor countries, when the passengers who continue the flight stay in the plane for 30-45 minutes, until the passengers who remain in that country get down from the plane and the new passengers come in.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/77/ae/default-avatar-2020-2.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebe_cluj,rebe_cluj wrote a review Jan 2016,rebe_cluj,"Southern Romania, Romania",19 contributions,7 helpful votes,Kigali - Victoria,Africa,Economy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729102-r343154194-Kenya_Airways-World.html,The pride of Africa,Date of travel: December 2015,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
